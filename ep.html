						<p>The Engineering Physics program at IIT-Bombay emphasizes on making students familiar with basic knowledge of physics along with a good background in various engineering disciplines. It is closer to the basic sciences than most of the other engineering departments. The core courses lay a good foundation in theory, while the engineering component comes from electronics labs and other engineering courses which enable the students to have a sound understanding of the fundamental principles working behind state of the art technologies. The focus of program is research and innovation and its aim is to develop students into physicists who are technologically aware and equipped with good engineering skills.</p>
						<h3>B.Tech Programme</h3>
						<p>The B.Tech. curriculum has a number of courses which introduce you to a wide variety of fields in Physics and applied Physics. The core courses cover basic areas such as classical and quantum mechanics, electromagnetic theory, optics, and thermodynamics along with introductory courses to the various fields. Electives further allow a student to explore their area of interest with more specialised courses on solid state physics, quantum computing and general theory of relativity to name a few. Laboratory courses cover the basic techniques used in all the fields coupled with a knowledge in electronics which is an essential asset to every experimentalist.
</p>
						<p>The major fields covered in the Engineering Physics programme at IITB are as follows:
</p>
						<h3>High Energy Physics  </h3>
						<p>High Energy Physics (HEP) is the study of some of the most basic questions about the existence of our Universe: the nature of the elementary constituents of matter and energy, the interactions between them, and the nature of space and time.   
<br>We have courses related to both theoretical and experimental aspects of HEP. Theory in HEP involves concepts in nuclear and particle physics with applications of Quantum Mechanics. The experimental part of HEP involves designing and building experiments to detect and identify particles through particle detectors and accelerators. Analysis of data from particle physics experiments also forms a large part of Experimental HEP. The discovery of the Higgs Boson by the LHC at CERN is a perfect example of a combination of Theory and Experiment in HEP. Many of the professors at IITB are collaborators at places like CERN and Fermilab and are involved in some of the world’s largest and most famous experiments.
</p>
						<h3>Condensed Matter Physics  
  </h3>
						<p>Matter exists in many fascinating forms. Metals, insulators, semiconductors, ferromagnets to name a few common ones and superconductors, topological insulators to name a few exotic ones. Condensed matter physics is the study of various such forms of matter. The department runs various courses on introductory condensed matter physics, statistical physics and quantum mechanics introduce students to field. Experimental condensed matter physics deals with experiments on matter to look for new behaviour and then explain it. Condensed matter physics is also used extensively in the electronic device industry. 
 <br>For those interested in the physics aspect of the semiconductor and electronic industry, we work on electron transport in novel materials (Graphene, thin films), from quantum dots, wires and wells to electron spin dynamics in solid state systems like defects in Diamond and Silicon.

<br>Condensed matter physics also includes the exciting new field of Biophysics. This includes the study of membranes, polymers and various other complex biological systems using theories from physics. Some professors also work collaboratively with the Biology department at IIT Bombay. 

<br>At IIT-B, we have strong ongoing research for both theoretical and experimental condensed matter physics. Our department has several  well equipped labs for experimental CMP. </p>
						
						<h3>Optics and Photonics   </h3>
						<p>Optics as the name suggests deals with study of light. It answers the questions about nature and behaviour of light in various environments and mediums. Photonics is a relatively recent branch of optics which came into being after Laser was discovered. In photonics we deal with optical phenomena occurring due to interaction of light with various forms of matter. This leads to many interesting and beautiful phenomena and a great range of applications like fiber-optics, optoelectronics, optical switching etc. It also deals with metamaterials which can lead to revolutionary applications like an invisibility cloak!
<br>At IIT-B we have dedicated labs with advanced lasers for experiments in photonics. We have strong ongoing research in theory as well as in experiments in both optics and photonics.
</p>
						<h3>B.Tech + M.Tech Dual Degree with specialization in Nanoscience and Integrated MSc in Physics
  </h3>
						<p>‘Nano’ is the current buzzword in research across all the fields. Nano is not just about making things smaller and smaller but also about studying the properties of materials as the size enters a particular regime. At this scale, the properties of materials change drastically and classical rules no longer hold. Behaviour at nanoscale is governed by a set of exciting rules from quantum mechanics and there are a number of interesting phenomena and numerous applications to explore.
<br>The Dual Degree students at IIT-B, in addition to courses with B-Tech students for the broad fields mentioned above, do a specific set of courses related to nanoscience. These courses deal with cutting edge research and cover important topics to propel  the student for a career in nanoscience. The courses include all the basic physics and understanding of phenomena at nanoscale and specific studies of materials like Graphene and Carbon-nanotubes, synthesis of such materials and nanofabrication processes. There are lab courses to give students hands-on experience on nanoscale techniques like Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) etc. This lab is one of the few in India which includes all such advanced equipments for undergraduate students. In their final year, all students do a year long intensive project as part of their curriculum related to the field of nanoscience.
<br>At IIT-B, the research in nanoscience is really dynamic and has many facets.To name a few: synthesis of nanoparticles for applications in sensing, solar cells, medical diagnosis; study of graphene and other carbon nanostructures like fulllerenes and carbon nanotubes with their applications; studies of quantum dots and their properties. We have Center for Excellence in Nanoelectronics (CEN) as a central facility at IIT-B, which is one of the best facilities in India for nanofabrication.

<br>From this year, students will have an option of converting to integrated MSc in physics in their fourth year on a case-by-case basis,  which will allow them to specialize in fields other than nanotechnology as well (Eg HEP, CMP, etc), provided the student fulfils certain criteria and subject to the availability of supervising professors in that field. 

<br>In conclusion, the Engineering Physics program at IIT Bombay is designed to give students the freedom to pursue  a career in Physics or to take up Research & Development across various fields.
