						<h3>Manish Shetty, Dual Degree, 2011</h3>
						<p>I am currently a PhD candidate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) looking to graduate in the next 2 - 2.5 years. I have had my share of non-core experience with a year of management consulting with Bain & Co in Mumbai. A lot of my experiences at IIT Bombay in general, and Chemical Engineering in particular has influenced my current trajectory, and I hope some of my experiences will help guide the decisions on incoming freshmen.</p>
						<p>I still remember the day I had to fill-up my choices and the confusions going on in my head. My initial reasons may have been naive but I will be honest in saying that I thought I liked Chemistry and Chemical Engineering suited different than I anticipated. I think Chemical Engineering involved a lot of Physics, and Math, along with its share of Chemistry. As I look back, the curriculum made me a well-rounded individual, ingraining a fair bit of analytical thinking which any engineer would need. Apart from the curriculum, the Department has an active Student Body with "ChEA-Chemical Engineering Association" organizing an annual Chemical Engineering Festival. Besides, "Project Bio-Synth" is a student-run Biodisel producing plant on campus. Each year students get to have hands-on experience Chemical Engineering experience. </p>
						<p>Options are immense once you graduate from the department. As the world moves towards being less fossil-fuel dependent, there are a lot of unsolved problems where Chemical Engineers can make a difference. If you only think about the energy crisis, there are lot of interesting problems to tackle right from biomass utilization, to making solar energy more efficient. If you are looking for jobs, petrochemical, chemical, and FMCG sectors always hire. In addition, further studies are also an option. </p>
						<p>Personally, projects in the Department helped me a lot in my decision to pursue PhD at MIT and faculty in the department helped me a lot in clearing my confusions when I switched track from management consulting to academics. Faculty have served as my friends, mentors, and guides. IITB would have played a huge role in my life whatever I may end up doing in the future.</p>
						<p>My only advice to incoming freshmen is to try and take a decision ideally without parental-pressure. Parents may think something is valuable to you, however, you have to live the rest of your life on your own. So think about your interests, talk to a few people but make YOUR OWN DECISION. Do not take a narrow minded decision based on what some people may say about any department. If you are somewhat interested, and put your mind to it, I am sure you will enjoy it. I am sure not all of you liked all your subjects but you still put your mind and soul to JEE and cleared your exams. If you give your mind and soul to your next endeavor, you will be rewarded!!! I wish you all the best!!</p>
						<h3>Anasuya Mandal, B.Tech, 2011</h3>
						<p>Having made it to the Indian National Chemistry Olympiad in 2007, I thought chemistry was my forte. Chemical Engineering was a branch within my AIR reach and its <a href="http://www.aiche.org/community/students/career-resources-k-12-students-parents/what-do-chemical-engineers-do">diverse applications</a> appealed to me. Interestingly, there was little to do with chemistry in chemical engineering. It was more of physics and math as we learnt about various kind of fluid flows and how heat and mass transfer work in the most basic as well as complex processes. I expected the course at IIT Bombay to provide with me decent exposure to some of these diverse aspects and indeed it did give me a flavour for quite a few things. I was involved for half my time at IIT with setting up a biodiesel plant from scratch. It was thrilling to design and fabricate a small scale plant which not only gave us a chance to put our chemical engineering knowledge in practice, but also watch a chemical plant being converted from blueprint to structure. The department fest, Azeotropy, as well as ICTâ€™s festival offered other opportunities to participate in chemical engineering based design competitions. During my summer internships I worked with Hindustan Unilever at their research center in Bangalore and at the University of Cambridge in UK. These internships exposed me to industrial and academic research, respectively. Simultaneously, many others from my class explored everything from management consulting to petrochemicals to food technology to biopharmaceutical manufacturing. 

<br><br>Chemical engineering offers one of the widest platters with respect to careers - be they research focused, technical or scientific positions or engineering focused, depending on what your aptitude and interest is toward. Almost everything under the sun can be linked to chemical engineering - coming up with efficient cooling technologies for the latest Intel chips, helping companies like Shell figure out how to extract oil from the deepest depths of the earth, scaling up a shampoo or ketchup production line, making sure that each tablet produced by a pharmaceutical company is up to the mark, figuring out smart ways to deliver drugs to tumors - all of these can be tied back to the basics that you will learn in your chemical engineering courses and the possibilities are endless. 

<br><br>I graduated with a B.Tech. in 2011 and currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. At MIT, I found that the rigors of my undergraduate coursework had left me very well prepared to handle the graduate subjects I needed to take. My work here is related to disease diagnostics and monitoring the human immune system, so that we can better understand how to design more effective vaccines for diseases like HIV and malaria. 

<br><br>IIT Bombay was where I spent my formative years. The people I met there, the values I cultivated, the mentors I learnt from and still continue to learn from - attending IIT Bombay is one decision I would take again and again, no matter how many times I am asked to reconsider where I want to pursue my undergraduate education. After my family, IIT is what has helped me be where I am today. </p>
