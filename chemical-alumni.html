						<h3>Anasuya Mandal, B.Tech, 2011</h3>
						<p>Having made it to the Indian National Chemistry Olympiad in 2007, I thought chemistry was my forte. Chemical Engineering was a branch within my AIR reach and its <a href="http://www.aiche.org/community/students/career-resources-k-12-students-parents/what-do-chemical-engineers-do">diverse applications</a> appealed to me. Interestingly, there was little to do with chemistry in chemical engineering. It was more of physics and math as we learnt about various kind of fluid flows and how heat and mass transfer work in the most basic as well as complex processes. I expected the course at IIT Bombay to provide with me decent exposure to some of these diverse aspects and indeed it did give me a flavour for quite a few things. I was involved for half my time at IIT with setting up a biodiesel plant from scratch. It was thrilling to design and fabricate a small scale plant which not only gave us a chance to put our chemical engineering knowledge in practice, but also watch a chemical plant being converted from blueprint to structure. The department fest, Azeotropy, as well as ICTâ€™s festival offered other opportunities to participate in chemical engineering based design competitions. During my summer internships I worked with Hindustan Unilever at their research center in Bangalore and at the University of Cambridge in UK. These internships exposed me to industrial and academic research, respectively. Simultaneously, many others from my class explored everything from management consulting to petrochemicals to food technology to biopharmaceutical manufacturing. 

<br><br>Chemical engineering offers one of the widest platters with respect to careers - be they research focused, technical or scientific positions or engineering focused, depending on what your aptitude and interest is toward. Almost everything under the sun can be linked to chemical engineering - coming up with efficient cooling technologies for the latest Intel chips, helping companies like Shell figure out how to extract oil from the deepest depths of the earth, scaling up a shampoo or ketchup production line, making sure that each tablet produced by a pharmaceutical company is up to the mark, figuring out smart ways to deliver drugs to tumors - all of these can be tied back to the basics that you will learn in your chemical engineering courses and the possibilities are endless. 

<br><br>I graduated with a B.Tech. in 2011 and currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. At MIT, I found that the rigors of my undergraduate coursework had left me very well prepared to handle the graduate subjects I needed to take. My work here is related to disease diagnostics and monitoring the human immune system, so that we can better understand how to design more effective vaccines for diseases like HIV and malaria. 

<br><br>IIT Bombay was where I spent my formative years. The people I met there, the values I cultivated, the mentors I learnt from and still continue to learn from - attending IIT Bombay is one decision I would take again and again, no matter how many times I am asked to reconsider where I want to pursue my undergraduate education. After my family, IIT is what has helped me be where I am today. </p>
