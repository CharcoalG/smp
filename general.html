						<h3>Letter to Parents</h3>
						<p>Dear Parent/Guardian,<br><br>
It gives us immense pleasure to congratulate you and your ward for the exemplary success at
IITJEE Advanced 2015. The Institute Student Mentorship Program (ISMP) would like to welcome
you and your ward to one of the most prestigious institutes in India, IIT Bombay (IITB). As you
might know, this institute has been home to some of the most distinguished personalities on the
global map, and we look forward to developing many more such minds that will serve for the
betterment of technology, our country and above all, mankind.<br><br>
We believe that, as well-informed parents, you should be familiarized with both the academic and
the extra-curricular lifestyle of students at this institute and get an idea about the various
opportunities that your child can get as well as the underlying responsibilities. The faculty at this
institute strives hard to make sure that the academic needs of each of their students are taken care of
and also to make his/her stay here fruitful. However, there may be times when students require help,
academic or otherwise, and we, at the ISMP see to it that these requirements are met promptly and
in the best way possible. We would like you to extend your assistance for the same by simply
making sure that you know a few things about this institute, to get a general idea of how things
function here. This letter is written with the purpose of helping you understand the same.
<br><br>
<strong>Institute Student Mentor Program (ISMP):</strong><br>
At this institute, we have respected and well accomplished senior students in their fourth/fifth year
of study mentoring all first year students. These mentors together constitute the Institute Student
Mentor Program aimed at providing guidance and help to first year students.. The mentors help the
first year students’ make a smooth transition from life at home to life at this institute and help in
clearing out hurdles in their path. It would be advisable for you to meet the mentors when you
arrive on campus for the orientation. It would be beneficial if you could also stay in touch with
mentors during the course of the semester.<br><br>
<strong>Academic Structure:</strong><br>
A typical academic year at IIT Bombay is divided into two semesters – Autumn Semester (July-November)
and Spring Semester (January-April). The curriculum at IIT Bombay is based on the
credit system. Each course is allotted credits based on the number of lectures, tutorials and lab hours
per week.<br><br>
There is continuous evaluation by means of quizzes, assignments, mid-semester, end-semester
examinations and lab work throughout the semester. At the end of each semester, the student gets an
SPI (Semester Performance Index) which is an average of the grades in each of the courses he/she
had registered for in that semester weighted with the credits of those courses respectively. CPI
(Cumulative Performance Index) is a weighted average of all the SPIs (till date) weighted on the
number of total credits each semester.<br><br>

The importance of maintaining a steady attendance in classes here cannot be understated. It is
advised that students do not miss classes due to trips home or otherwise. Also, it is absolutely
compulsory for all students to attend classes during the first week of each semester, except for
genuine medical reasons. When medical problems arise, the student is advised to inform the mentor
and the professors concerned if he/she is missing classes. Professors might require medical
certificates issued or authenticated by the IITB Hospital or other supporting documents in such
cases. <br><br>
Students who enter this institute every year are some of the best brains in the country. Due to the
competitive environment here, we have often experienced cases where students, who until then had
always topped their class, found it difficult to get grades that met their expectations. This has often
led to one of two extremes: some students face excessive parental pressure, while others simply
adopt an indifferent attitude which further reduces their academic performance. We hope that you
would encourage your ward to put his/her best foot forward - treat the best effort from his/her side
as the objective, rather than the results.<br><br>
<strong>Hostel Life:</strong><br>
At this institute, we believe in the overall development of our students. General lifestyle of students
includes a lot of extracurricular activities in fields of sports, cultural and technical activities, at
intra-hostel, inter-hostel and inter-college events. The environment is very conducive to growth and
our institute has some of the best facilities across India. So, we encourage students to take up
whatever interests them and we request you to support them in their choices. There is enough time
in a normal IIT student’s day to fit in both academics and extracurricular activities without much
stress. But, at the same time, it is advised that care must be taken to ensure proper time management
such that academics are not neglected because of such activities.<br><br>
Hostels form an integral part of every IIT students’ life. The hostels are well equipped with
necessary infrastructure and mess facilities. First year students stay in double-sharing hostel rooms
with their batchmates.<br><br>
The transition of your ward, from your loving and caring hands to a completely new competitive
environment of IIT could occasionally cause adjustment problems in the initial period of their stay.
Many students find it difficult getting used to a roommate and hostel life for the first time.
Sometimes, cultural, social and language differences further delay the settling process. As mentors,
we help the freshmen have a smooth transition so that this settling process is as short as possible
and your wards feel comfortable in this new setting quickly.<br><br>
<strong>Financial Help:</strong><br>
In case you are worried about how expensive it is going to be to put your son/daughter through
college, don’t be. Help is always given at IITB to those who need it, whether that be of academic,
financial or any other kind. Scholarships in the form of Merit cum Means and Free Messing are
provided to the eligible students that discount the tuition fees and the mess fees respectively. You
can find more information about these in the leaflet on scholarships that you will receive shortly or
ask your ward’s mentor.<br><br>
<strong>Some important issues:</strong><br>
Ragging in any form is strictly banned in the campus. The student should report any such untoward
incident to his/her mentor immediately. We assure you that it will be dealt with confidentiality and
with highest priority. We believe that you will be reassured by the steps that have been taken by the
institute to prevent ragging. Interaction of the freshmen with seniors (other than the appointed
mentors) is heavily curtailed during their first month, so they get time to adjust. Strict penalties are
very much in place, and mentors are always available to resolve any situations promptly. Rest
assured, ragging has vanished from the IIT-Bombay campus.<br><br>
However, it is expected that the freshmen develop a healthy rapport with seniors as they themselves
are amongst the brightest in the country and excel at various activities. In fact, a healthy senior
junior interaction has been the hallmark of this institute and we would like to maintain that.
Our purpose of sharing the above mentioned problems with you is to make you aware of them. As
parents, you need not be alarmed, but mental preparation and precautionary measures would
definitely help.<br><br>
In case you have doubts or you need to know more about any aspect of IITB, please comment below using your facebook account and we will be happy to answer your questions. <br><br>
We hope that this information gives you a fair idea about the life of your ward in the next few years. This
institute offers a wide range of opportunities for all who wish to learn in the various spheres of life
and we hope that he/she has a productive and memorable time in the institute.<br><br>
Best wishes,<br>
Student Mentor Program<br>

<b>Appendix</b>

<br>Calculation of SPI and CPI:<br>

<br>Suppose in a given semester a student has taken four courses having credits C1, C2, C3 and C4 and grade points in those courses are G1, G2, G3 and G4 respectively. Then,<br>

<br>SPI = (C1 x G1 + C2 x G2 + C3 x G3 + C4 x G4) / (C1 + C2 + C3 + C4)
<br>CPI = (SPI1 x Credits in semester1 + SPI2 x Credits in semester2 + ...) / (Total credits)<br>

<br>For example, if in a given semester a student has taken four courses having credits 6, 6, 8, and 6 and grade points in those courses are 10, 9, 8, 6 respectively. Then, 
<br>SPI = (6 x 10  +  6 x 9  +  8 x 8  +  8 x 6) / (6 + 6 + 8 + 6) = 7.62<br>

<br>If the student has an SPI of 7.62 in the 1st semester worth (say) 32 credits and 8.2 in the next semester worth 36 credits,
<br>CPI (at the end of 2nd semester) = (7.62 x 32  +  8.2 x 36) / (32 + 36) = 7.93<br>

<br>Do note that all semesters have more or less equal credit weightage, so it is important to do well throughout, and not just in final exams, in order to maintain a good CPI.

<b>Grading:</b><br>

<br>The system of grading here, in most courses, is relative. The highest grade (worth 10 points) is set according to the highest score obtained in the class, and proportionately, grades are allotted to all students. Grading, in integral values out of 10 is done based on the student’s performance throughout the semester and goes from 10 to 4 (AA-10, AB-9, BB-8, BC-7, CC-6, CD-5, DD-4),.<br>

<br>Detailed rules can be found in the ‘Rules and Regulations’ booklet which you will receive subsequently. Parents and students are requested to go through and understand it carefully.

						<h3>The Must Haves - What to (NOT) get from home</h3>
						<p><p>This is probably the first time most of you will be moving away from home, and even for those who were away for coaching
- this will be your first experience in setting up your rooms all by yourself. The rooms in campus are typically small in size
and a little tight to accommodate, a fact that often shocks/scares parents, but then it encourages two things which will
really benefit you in the long run :</p>

<p>1. Spending major chunks of time away from your room (except exam times :D)</br> 
2. Adjusting and all associated terms with your room-mate (who, as you will realize, might become one of the most
important persons in your life)</p>

<p>From our experience, we bring to you a list of items - essentials and optionals. It may not be exhaustive
but has most of the things. To make it easier, we've colour-coded the items for you : <br>
a) <font color="red"><strong>Red</strong></font> - Definitely <font color="black"><strong>must get</strong></font> from home.<br>
b) <font color="blue"><strong>Blue</strong></font> - You may bring these if you already have them.<br>
c) <font color="green"><strong>Green</strong></font> - Best purchased from Mumbai.<br>
The rest are to your discretion. </p>
<!--
<p>For information on where to buy stuff, read 
<a href="http://gymkhana.iitb.ac.in/~smp/forum/index.php?topic=29.0">  
In IIT and Around Mumbai - Where to shop, eat and have fun.</a></p>-->
 
<strong>Room necessities:</strong><br>
(Two cots,a table, a chair, and a cupboard, all of fairly decent quality are provided by the institute in every room)<br><br>

1. <font color="red"><strong>Clothing + Raingear</strong></font>: Mumbai is usually known for warm to hot summers, heavy rains and mildly
cold winters. So, carry more of light summer wear. <em>Do your packing/shopping keeping in mind that clothes do not dry
quickly during the monsoons.</em> You may choose to postpone carrying winter wear (a blanket or quilt and a pair of jackets
should do just fine to keep you warm) to your Diwali break or the December holidays. <em>Carry an umbrella and/or a raincoat
and have them on you all the time during the Monsoon months</em>. There is no dress code in the institute but you are expected
to dress up decently. It's convenient to wear cargos or shorts for the rainy months. Apart from that, you are free to wear
what you want - T-shirts, jeans, shorts, shirts - whatever. You might also want to get a pair of <font color="blue">traditional
clothes</font>. Most departments celebrate a department traditional day in the autumn semester.<br>Do get <font color="red">Umbrellas</font>
along. Rainwear that may suffice in many other places might still not be enough to shield you from Mumbai rains.<br><br>

2. <strong>Footwear</strong>: A pair of <font color="red">slippers/floaters</font>, a pair of sandals and a pair of <font color="red">covered
shoes</font> (you would need to wear these to your labs) is recommended. Get footwear that you can use in the rain - at least
one pair that won't become unusable if wet. Shoes specific to some sports might be bought after coming here. However, you may
carry <font color="red">gum soled shoes and football studs</font> if you have a pair already.<br><br>

3. <strong>Stationery</strong>: We advise you to skip carrying any. There are enough shops around. But if you already have them, you might carry
a <font color="blue">Scientific Calculator</font> (FX 991 MS/ES by Casio are the ones most of your seniors use), Staplers (with
pins), Punching machines, U-bend pins, binder clips and a couple of folders. <font color="green">Workshop Tools, ED Instruments</font>
and <font color="blue">Lab Coats</font> that you would need may be shared among batch-mates, borrowed from seniors, or bought here.
If you have your Class XII Lab Coat at hand, do bring it along.<br><br>

4. <strong>Books</strong>: Though you won't need all books that you used for JEE Preparations, you might want to bring some standard ones. Look
at the section on <a href="http://gymkhana.iitb.ac.in/~smp/acads.html?id=firstyear"> First year Courses</a> to know more about
your courses and plan accordingly. However, you might want to carry standard ones like <span style="color: blue;">Thomas and Finney,
Atkins, JD Lee, Solomon, etc.</span><br><br>

5. <strong>Clotheslines, Hangers, Cloth hanging clips:</strong> There are ropes meant for hanging clothes outside every room,
but if you prefer using your rooms for drying clothers during monsoons or hanging them in the balcony, carry (or buy from here)
<span style="color: red;" class="bbc_color">some clotheslines and clothespins</span>. Hangers aren't provided in the rooms.
<br><br>

6. <strong><span style="color: red;">Bed sheets</span>, <span style="color: green;">mattresses and pillows</span> and
<span style="color: red;">pillow covers</span> </strong>(extra set is preferable as drying is a problem in rains), Curtains
(optional), Blanket or quilt (you could opt to get this after your Diwali break too, the typical cold season begins only in
late November or early December and lasts into the mid of January).<br><br>

7. <strong><span style="color: green;">Bucket, Mug, Waste Paper Bin, Soap Cases</span>:</strong> Buy them from either the many
shops outside the Market/YP Gate, or the temporary shacks outside Hostel 4 which are set up for a week about the time you enter.<br><br>

8. <strong><span style="color: red;">Lock and keys</span> (2 sets of keys as you'd be sharing the room):</strong> Keep extra sets
handy. While travelling, you might want to lock your luggage as well.<br><br>

9. <strong><span style="color: blue;">Net for window</span>:</strong> There is a serious problem of insects in campus,
especially during your initial days when the monsoon season is still on. It is advised you have nets fitted to your windows. 
Usually, a vendor visits the hostel during the initial few days for this. You might find the rates exorbitant but you have 
little choice. You could split the charges with your roommate.<br><br>

10. <strong><span style="color: green;">Anti-insect sprays</span>, <span style="color: red;" >bed-bug sprays, All Out,
Odomos</span>, <span style="color: blue;">Naphthalene Balls</span>:</strong> It is strongly suggested you keep these items
with you, you will find them useful. <br><br>

11. <strong><span style="color: blue;" >Spike guard, Multiplugs</span>:</strong> You would typically have only 1 plug point
per person in the room (or, in some cases, just 1 per room), so extension boards are a must. Also, the power supply is meant
for 5 Ampere applications, so please do not carry any heavy electrical appliances like Irons/Heaters unless you have ensured
that the current rating is not above 5A.<br><br>

12. <strong><font color="green">Broom</font>:</strong> Rooms are cleaned once a week by the House Cleaning Staff of the
Hostels. The rest is your responsibility.<br><br>

13. <strong>Miscellaneous:</strong> <font color="red">Medicine kit</font> (advised, you may not want to go to the IIT 
Hospital for every little thing), soap, shampoo, handwash, detergent, brush, torch etc. Sports equipment, if you play 
or are enthu enough (racquets, balls, proper shoes etc) and for music enthusiasts, your own guitar, santoor, flute or 
tabla - anything.<br><br>

The good thing about being in Mumbai is that you can buy almost everything from here at reasonable prices (if you know
where to look). Don't hesitate to ask seniors - their opinion is invaluable at most times. So, don't fret if you forget
to carry something. Carry the basics so that the first thing you don't have to go shopping the moment you reach Mumbai.<br><br>

Feel free to reply on this post for related queries.<br><br>Happy Settling In!<br><br>
