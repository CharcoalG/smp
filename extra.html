						<h3>Culturals at IIT-B</h3>
						<p>So you thought it was all about academics? Wrong! IITB is privileged to have one of the best cultural (or 'cult') scenes among engineering colleges in India. Apart from hosting Mood Indigo, India's biggest college cultural festival, we have a very active intra-college scene, with genre specific clubs and plenty of hostel and insti-level events all year round. The scene is basically split into 7 genres: Music, Photography & Fine Arts, Speaking/Debating, Literary Arts, Photography & Fine Arts, Dance, Dramatics, and  Film & Media.
<br>
<br>
<b>The Scene</b><br>
At the Institute level, the scene is governed by the Institute Cultural Council, headed by the General Secretary of Cultural Affairs. Working with him are 7 Institute Secretaries, for the aforementioned 7 genres. Each secretary is the head of the club(s) under his/her domain.
Also, at the hostel level, each hostel has a Cultural Councilor along with a secretary for each of the genres.
<br><br>
<b>Freshizza</b><br>
The most important cultural event of your first semester here is Freshizza, the inter-hostel freshmen cultural competition. Usually held in 2 phases over the first semester, Freshizza is where you battle it out for hostel glory in a host of events from all areas of the cult sphere. Do participate, if you can, or else at least come and cheer your hostel on.
@Localites: Stay back that weekend, we guarantee you won't regret it.
<br><br>
<b>Intra College events</b><br>
Inter-hostel General Championship (GC) events that are held throughout the year decide your hostel's position in the Cultural GC, winning which is very prestigious. Even though freshies are not allowed to represent their hostel, to compensate, the cultural council organizes a huge number of open events spread across the year. These events have no restrictions; some, on the contrary, have freshmen reservations.
<br><br>
Now, coming to the Cultural clubs.
<br><br>
<b>Literary Arts: Literati</b><br>
Quizzes, Creative writing, Rebuses, Blogs and Word Games all fall under the reign of Literati. GC Event: General quiz, Mixed Bag GC, Word Games GC, Wolf Pack GC
<br><br><b>Dramatics: Fourth Wall</b><br>
Comedy plays, street plays and mono-acting are the strengths of the club. The spotlight is grabbed by the Annual Theatre Festival and Sophie Production. 
GC event: Dramatics Main Championship
<br><br><b>Music: Staccato and Saaz</b><br>
The clubs for western and Indian music respectively. They conduct large scale musical events and workshops. Watch out for Saaz's Surbahar and Swar Sandhya, and Staccato's Acoustic Dusk and Unplugged. 
GC event: Goonj
<br><br><b>Film and Media: Silverscreen</b><br>
The youngest club on the campus, Silverscreen has already scaled great heights with the introduction of the IIT Bombay Film Festival, showcasing student-made films along with celebrated international movies. We have had the likes of Aamir Khan, Anurag Kashyap, Shekhar Kapoor, Nandita Das and many others who have graced IITB Filmfest.
GC Event: Film Making
<br><br><b>Dance: In Sync</b><br>
Classical, hip-hop, folk or contemporary, In Sync has it all. The Annual Insync Dance Show (AIDS) held in January is a must watch. Probably the largest cultural club of IIT Bombay.
GC Event: Gyrations
<br><br><b>Debating: We-Speak and Vaani</b><br>
Speak your mind! Panel debates, JAMs, extempore, radioplays... you name it. Host to the IIT Bombay National Debate. 
GC Event: Debate GC, Jam GC, KavyaSandhya
<br><br><b>Photography and Fine Arts - Rang and Pixels</b><br>
Rang is the Fine Arts Club and Pixels, the photography club conduct competitions and workshops for everything from sponge modelling to comic strip writing to Adobe Photoshop. They showcase the institute talent in the the annual exhibition Kaladarshan. 
GC Event: Photography GC, Fine Arts GC, 3-D Modelling GC etc
<br>
<br>
<b>Design Club</b><br>
When creativity meets passion, design happens. Design is thoughts given shape; to put together the pieces of a puzzle, not knowing of what would unfold. Have an idea? Give it shape and bring it into existence; scribble it out or express yourself digitally. The Design team came into existence last year, with the motive of creating a culture of design in the institute, bringing together aspects from all genres of art. The amazing response we got has encouraged us to go further and expand across the genres, to have infrastructure set aside for enthusiastic people. This year will see the integration of design into Vision, the institute's photography and design festival.
<br>
<br>
<b>Classical & Folk Arts - Roots </b><br>
So, ‘Roots’ -The Classical and Folk Arts Club of IIT Bombay , as its name suggests, aims to replenish the art form- Classical and Folk arts that had taken birth decades before.
A place where dance , music and arts can be enjoyed together in a traditional way!
Roots provides you all the sugar candies that’ll simply tempt you to evolve the classical artist within, be it learning , expressing or listening and viewing the maestros!
<br>
<br>
<b>Fasion Club - Lifestyle</b><br>
Lifestyle Club, IIT Bombay is an initiative of the Institute Cultural Council of IIT Bombay. This club caters to various 'topics' related to 'Lifestyle' of people in IIT Bombay. Everyone from IIT Bombay can be a part of this club as a member, moderator or active follower, without any bar of knowledge, credentials and skills. This is a club of people who want to explore more.

Presently the club has Fashion as its major sub-genre, Cuisine and Spirituality would be launched shortly this year. The club gives you an opportunity to be a part of workshops of walking the ramp, photoshoots, designing costumes and also the club would be coming up with Halloween Party for the institute this year.

<br>
<br>
So, now you have a good idea about the different clubs and the different genres. Too much information? No worries, there will be an orientation (with a fundae session) for each club separately too. Just make it a habit to have a look at the notice-boards  daily. For details visit the Cult Homepage.
<br><br>
<b>Inter college events</b><br>
Every December, IITB hosts India's biggest cult fest, Mood Indigo. MI is a 4 day long cultural extravaganza that sees participation by thousands of students from all over the country. Apart from formal and informal competitions and workshops, it also organizes concerts and performances by international artistes.
<br>
IITB students attend numerous college cult fests but we only send official contingents to two, St. Xavier's Malhar (around 15th Aug) in Mumbai and IIM-A's Chaos (around 29th Jan). Freshies generally attend Chaos in large numbers.
<br><br>
<b>Performing Arts Festival (PAF)</b><br>
PAF is also known as the 'Baap of all cultural events'. Typically three or four hostels (out of fourteen) are grouped together to battle against one another. From script to dance, music to dram, every damn thing is handled by the students. PAF is renowned for its 'Prod work' which involves the making of sets and backdrops. A tremendous mixture of art and cultural skills combined with life sized sets, is what makes PAF an event to remember.
<br>
By that time, you will be allotted your 'permanent' hostels and hence will be a good time to make new friends and get acquainted with the hostel culture.
<br>
At the end of the academic year, the institute hands out awards to those who have excelled in cultural activities, along with the inter-hostel GC and PAF trophies.
<br>
So there you have it. Cult at IITB is truly in a league of its own, so please do grab every opportunity to be a part of it. And remember, never be hesitant to join a club or attend a meeting just because you feel you're not good enough - most of us knew nothing about our current cult interests/passions when we first started out, back in our first years. The institute clubs welcome students of all levels, from noobs to pros.
<br>
A mandatory word of caution though: do not sacrifice your academics for the sake of extra-curricular activities; prioritize your interests and allocate your time wisely. That being said, we do hope you enjoy every bit of your 4/5 years here, and hopefully the cultural scene would be a major part of your college lives.

						<h3>Sports at IIT-B</h3>
						<p>Welcome to Sports@IITB ¦ You are gonna love it !<br><br>

Sports Homepage: http://gymkhana.iitb.ac.in/~sports/index.php<br>
Facebook Page : https://www.facebook.com/iitbsports<br><br>
 
The first time you will hear about sports will be during your Institute Orientation when you will be asked to fill out your preferences for NSO, NSS and NCC. There's a whole page dedicated to NSO/NCC and NSS, but in short, as a part of your first year curriculum, you are expected to participate in either a sport (NSO), or the NCC or community service through NSS.  Bear in mind that this is a part of your curriculum and thus, you will be graded on it (Pass or Not Pass). 
<br><br>
<b>Important:</b><br> Know that there have been past cases of students receiving a Not Pass grade. Usually, you can avoid it by attending your sessions regularly and maintaining a good rapport with your instructor in charge.
<br><br>
<b>Facilities</b><br>
IITB has a Cricket Field, a flood-lit Football field, a Hockey field, 6 synthetic tennis courts, a volleyball court, a newly built Olympic-size Swimming pool, 5 wooden Badminton courts, 2 basketball courts, an Institute Table Tennis room, 1 squash court, athletic track, 2 gymnasiums, 1 weightlifting room and much more.
<br>
To add to all these, there is a whole new Sports Complex coming up which will comprise of 2 Indoor Basketball, 3 Inddor Volleyball, 3 Indoor Cricket pitches, 3 Glass-back Squash court, TT Hall, and a Mega-Gym facility.
<br>
Timings of most facilities extend from 6 in the morning to mid-night.
<br><br>
 
<b>The Sports Culture: Training Camps and Championships:</b><br>
Besides NSO, IITB offers beginner's training camps (organized by Institute Sports Secretaries)in all sports for which you can register and get started. Notices for the camps are typically put up a week in advance. The camps consist of 8-10 sessions on a daily or weekly basis in which the basics of the game are taught. Seats are usually limited, so register at the earliest.
<br>
IIT Bombay has a history of healthy inter hostel rivalry. The Inter Hostel Sports General Championship is the biggest event in sports at the institute level and has witnessed really good participation from the freshie hostels. Institute Opens and Intra hostel competitions organized for Cricket, Carrom Intra, TT Intra, Volleyball, Football, Frisbee etc give an excellent opportunity to interact with your batchies and seniors.
<br>

The Institute also organizes IFL(Institute Footer League) and ICL( Institute Cricket League) in the Spring Semester on the lines of the EPL and IPL with managers and a bidding ceremony. One can register as a player or a Manager! Recently Volleyball, TT, Tennis Open and Basketball Leagues have also started. 
<br>
The Institute Sports council also organizes screenings of important matches/games for almost every sport, be it Rafa vs Federer, an El-classico or an India-Pak match you can catch it on the big screen with your friends :)
 <br><br>
<b>Inter IIT Championship:</b><br>
It is The Holy Grail of every guy or girl who ever picked up a racquet, kicked a ball or scored three pointers, representing IITB in the Inter IIT Sports Meet is the Ultimate Honor. Held in December over a duration of 5-7 days in one of the IITs, each of the 15 IITs arrive with their contingents and compete fiercely for the individual championships for each sport (Athletics, Aquatics, Badminton, Basketball, etc etc). Other than top three in individual sports, there is also the General Championship. IIT Bombay won the General Championship or 3 consecutive years 07-09 and in 2012, a significant credit of which goes to the first year students who have been stepping up and filling the void created by passing out seniors. 
<br>
Selection trials for the teams are held for each sport around October - November. The selected players are a part of the Inter IIT Training Camp held from 1st December to the date of departure for the meet. Based on the performances during camp, the best possible team is chosen by the coaches and the captain. To make it to the team in the first year itself is a big achievement for a freshie (specially in recent years with IITB teams doing so well) so, give it your best shot!
<br>PS : There’s a seperate Inter hostel GC and Inter IIT GC for the girls too.  
<br><br>
Note: You need not have pursued NSO in a sport to go for the trials. For that matter, it is not necessary for you to choose NSO at all, to be in the Institute team.
  <br><br>
<b>Sports@Leisure:</b> <br>
Apart from these formal coaching camps and classes, feel free to turn up on the sports field and play the way you like with or without your friends. Some timings are reserved for faculty and institute team practices and NSO classes. As IIT provides the state-of-art facilities, a lot of care has to be taken in maintenance. So, proper equipment and attire are must for playing. Specifically, in Badminton, Tennis and Squash, you must wear non-marking, gum sole shoes. You will find out details on more such requirements and where to get them in due time. You can issue squash balls, badminton shuttles and racquets on your I-card from the SAC office. 
<br>
IITB has a Cricket Field, a Flood-lit Football field, a Hockey field, 6 tennis courts, a volleyball court, a newly built Olympic-size Swimming pool, 5 wooden Badminton courts, 2 basketball courts, an Institute Table Tennis room, 1 squash court, athletic track, 2 gymnasiums, 1 weightlifting room and much more.
Most hostels have a lounge which has a carrom table, table tennis table, a gymnasium maybe a fooseball table and a pool table. You can issue the gear for these from the watchman against your I-card. You will also find people playing cricket, football and volleyball in the fields between the wings.  Get yourself out there with these guys! This is the best way to get to know your batchies and seniors. And don't worry if you think you are not so good! Nobody is and nobody cares! 
 <br><br>
<b>The Structure of Sports Council: </b><br>
The sports council is headed by the General Secretary Sports who coordinates the activities of all the Institute Secretaries (IS) of the various sports. The ISs are responsible for conducting events related to their sports at the institute level. At the hostel level, there is a Sports Councillor (or Sports co) who is supported in his activities by Hostel Sports Secretaries (Sports secy-s). 
 <br><br>
<b>Some Miscellaneous Tips:</b><br>
Injuries: Injuries are a part and parcel of every sport. You should know is that every hostel has its First Aid Kit, which can be usually be taken from the Sports-secy of the hostel. In case of more serious injuries, you should go to the IITB Hospi ( link here ) and have it looked it.
 <br><br>
<b>Where to buy sporting equipment:</b> <br>
All hostels have a stationary-cum-multi purpose shop. You can buy TT balls, shuttles, and other small equipment from these shops. The closest complete Sports shop called Extreme Sports is located in Hiranandani Galleria. The best place to buy your equipment is near Churchgate, Metro Theatre around which there are a large number of Sports shops. One of the most popular ones is Selection Sports. There are also sports shops in Andheri and Thane.
 <br>
Well, that's all you need to know about Sports@IITB. You are all set to become a part of the Sporting Community of IIT Bombay. We Wish You Loads of Fun and hope you have some of your Best Moments on the Fields!

<br><u>Line Following Bot competition</u> -  Flight enthusiasts, this event is for you. Held in early November, this will introduce you to flight dynamics and propulsion methods.
<br><u>Line Following Bot competition</u> - Compete against your peers in other IITs in identifying as many Messier objects in the night sky in as little time as possible.
<br><u>Line Following Bot competition</u> - In the beginning of February, be prepared for some heavy Tech action as a slew of workshops and competitions over a weekend put you in a state of Tech nirvana.
<br><u>Line Following Bot competition</u> - Over the summers, several freshmen and seniors alike stay back in the institute for some heavy-duty tech action, and build uber-cool stuff like the quadcopter you have seen in 3 Idiots, the Android app you have always thought should exist, or even a walking humanoid! Anything is possible.
<br><br>

<b>Biosynth</b><br>
Project ‘Biosynth’ is a first ever student’s initiative of installing a self sustained Biodiesel producing plant at an institute level in India. The project’s long term vision is to come up with an efficient technology that can substantially reduce pollution and country’s dependence on imported fuels. We entail utilizing waste vegetable oil as its raw material to produce an environment friendly fuel, Biodiesel. The biodiesel produced will be utilized to run institute vehicles like buses, cars, and ambulance in the initial stages. This is an initiative taken by the Chemical Engineering department faculties and students, which will provide hands on experience to build a biodiesel plant.

<b>Inter College Festivals</b><br>

There are a lot of local college festivals which are very accessible to freshman teams from the Institute. More details on these will be available through their specific website and through the STAB website. IIT Bombay also has a strong tradition of winning participation at Techfest. Some problem statements at Techfest are again very accessible to freshman. More details about these are available on the Techfest website and through various sessions held at both the hostel and institute level.
<br><br>
<b>Where to Begin</b><br>

Apart from Technical Orientation at the start of the year, most clubs and teams will have their individual orientations and beginner level events. Keep an eye out for posters on the Hostel Notice Boards. In addition all the clubs have dedicated web-pages and online discussion boards where activities are discussed in great detail. It would be a great idea to sign up for these. In addition feel free to contact the individual club conveners to help you out with your queries. 
<br>
Most hostels also have Tech Rooms which are accessible through contact with Technical Secretary. Finally, some of the Institute labs may be made accessible for personal use after contacting the person in-charge.
<br>
Another great idea to stay in touch with Tech is to engage yourself in one of the various projects running through the Institute. Apart from these one can also float personal projects which can be coordinated with either UMIC or one of the hobby clubs depending upon the exact idea in question.
<br>
Note: Most of the newsgroups are Google groups and it would be a nice idea to sign up for a Google account if you don't have one yet. Here we have barely scratched the surface of the scope of Tech at IITB. More detailed information is readily available on the club web pages and newsgroups
