								<h3>Yash Sheth, MEMS Dual Degree, 2014</h3>
							<p>I am Yash Sheth and graduated from MEMS in August 2014 with a dual degree (B.Tech + M.Tech specialization in ceramics and composites)â€‹ and currently I am working at Apple Inc.</p><br>
							<p>Before I joined IIT-B we had a counselling session on the day we were supposed to fill out our preferences for the field+IIT where we wanted to study. After discussing with a few seniors present there, 
I had an option whether to give preference to the stream of study I wanted or the campus where I wanted to study. Although it wasn't a black and white decision, some streams at other IITs were on the higher side of preference list but in the end I decided to choose IIT-B over other IITs and the reasons were as follows:
<br>1) I was looking forward to a combined "study + fun" environment and IIT-B had a perfect balance of both, a rigorous curriculum and plethora of activities going in and around the campus which helps for overall growth
<br>2) I lived in Bombay so it would be convenient to enjoy both independent life as well as spending time with family. 
<br>3) Being in the city, one would expect the job scene to be better than other IITs (Which was bubble that bursts when one gets to know of placements@IITs though the jobs are pretty good but the salary quoted in the newspapers are for a few and after the foreign currency conversion rates but do not consider the PPP, however let that be a topic for another day)
<br>So after having decided on my campus preference I choose a list of fields i wanted to and was glad that I got into MEMS.</p>
						<p>From the courses, I learnt about different materials, polymers, ceramics, composites and batteries and what not. In my final year as a part of my thesis I got to work with Applied Materials and such interaction with professionals while on campus itself helped my get a professional attitude right from the start.</p>	
						<p>From the placement perspective, very few companies come with focus solely on Material Science students, but there are a lot of jobs out there if you want to pursue this field and also other analytics/banking/consulting jobs if you want to move out of this field. I got placed at TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductors Manufacturing Company) through campus placement ad worked in Taiwan for 9 months before I started working for Apple in Singapore recently. 
Alternatively students who are enthusiastic about the career prospects in this field could pursue a PhD. It is a very interesting field to remain in if you get a liking for it and although the job prospects may not be much in India but there are plenty of opportunities if you are fine with living abroad.</p></div>
