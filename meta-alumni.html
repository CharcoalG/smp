					<h3>Saransh Singh, MEMS Dual Degree, 2013</h3>
					<p>First and foremost, congrats on making it through the Joint Entrance Exam. Now begins the arduous and overwhelming process of choosing your majors/branch. I have been in your shoes and it is not a trivial decision. So don't be bogged down if you're feeling confused and a little lost. </p>
					<p>I graduated from the Metallurgical Engineering and Materials Science department (MEMS or sometimes referred to as Meta) in 2013 with a dual degree. I was very interested in applied physics and considering the constraints that my JEE rank imposes on me, I tried to find the perfect compromise between studying something that I found interesting, and going to one of the older, more established IITs. </p>
					<p>
Metallurgy and Materials Science is an amazingly multidisciplinary field. It lies at the intersection of Physics, Chemistry, Chemical and Mechanical engineering. There are endless possibilities in this field if your interests lie in studying physics or chemistry. Three of the last six Nobel Prizes in physics have gone to material scientists! Some of the most talked about discoveries of the last decade, like Graphene, have been related to this field.</p>
<p>
IIT Bombay has a very good curriculum when it comes to MEMS. I was very satisfied with the courses running in the department and the manner in which the courses were conducted by most faculty members. Like any other major, you'll have to go through a couple of courses which you don't find all that exciting or interesting, but there are plenty of intriguing courses to fuel your curiosity. Apart from courses, the department has a very strong undergraduate research culture. The professors are very friendly and engage with the students in a constructive way. Your experience in the department is very rewarding if you work hard and are willing to learn.</p>
<p>There is plenty to do at IITB apart from academics. There are excellent sports facilities. You'll have plenty of opportunities to hone your managerial skills during the myriad of cultural, technical and organizational activities going on around the year. Personally, I was very active in hostel and the department councils. Those were some of the most memorable days of my life.</p>
<p>Due to our illustrious alumni, IITB has a stellar reputation in both industry and academic circles. If you've done well in your courses and extra curricular activities, then finding a job or getting an admit to a top graduate degree program is not very difficult. What is special about this place is that it prepares you for much more than just a job. People from this institution have been seminal in setting up the entrepreneurship ecosystem in Mumbai, what is referred to as Powai Valley, India's equivalent to Silicon Valley. After graduation, I got a job at Gulf Talent through the placement cell. The job was in Dubai with a lush pay. But like many of my peers, I chose to go to graduate school instead. Right now i'm working towards my doctoral degree in Material Science and Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. I expect to finish my education by 2017.</p>
<p>In closing, I'd like to congratulate you again on being some of the best minds in India and I hope I was able to answer some of the questions that you might have had. Remember, this is just the beginning. The possibilities are infinite. Best of luck and happy choosing!</p>
					<h3>Yash Sheth, MEMS Dual Degree, 2014</h3>
						
							
								
							<p>I am Yash Sheth and graduated from MEMS in August 2014 with a dual degree (B.Tech + M.Tech specialization in ceramics and composites)â€‹ and currently I am working at Apple Inc.</p>
							<p>Before I joined IIT-B we had a counselling session on the day we were supposed to fill out our preferences for the field+IIT where we wanted to study. After discussing with a few seniors present there, 
I had an option whether to give preference to the stream of study I wanted or the campus where I wanted to study. Although it wasn't a black and white decision, some streams at other IITs were on the higher side of preference list but in the end I decided to choose IIT-B over other IITs and the reasons were as follows:
<br>1) I was looking forward to a combined "study + fun" environment and IIT-B had a perfect balance of both, a rigorous curriculum and plethora of activities going in and around the campus which helps for overall growth
<br>2) I lived in Bombay so it would be convenient to enjoy both independent life as well as spending time with family. 
<br>3) Being in the city, one would expect the job scene to be better than other IITs (Which was bubble that bursts when one gets to know of placements@IITs though the jobs are pretty good but the salary quoted in the newspapers are for a few and after the foreign currency conversion rates but do not consider the PPP, however let that be a topic for another day)
<br>So after having decided on my campus preference I choose a list of fields i wanted to and was glad that I got into MEMS.</p>
						<p>From the courses, I learnt about different materials, polymers, ceramics, composites and batteries and what not. In my final year as a part of my thesis I got to work with Applied Materials and such interaction with professionals while on campus itself helped my get a professional attitude right from the start.</p>	
						<p>From the placement perspective, very few companies come with focus solely on Material Science students, but there are a lot of jobs out there if you want to pursue this field and also other analytics/banking/consulting jobs if you want to move out of this field. I got placed at TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductors Manufacturing Company) through campus placement ad worked in Taiwan for 9 months before I started working for Apple in Singapore recently. 
Alternatively students who are enthusiastic about the career prospects in this field could pursue a PhD. It is a very interesting field to remain in if you get a liking for it and although the job prospects may not be much in India but there are plenty of opportunities if you are fine with living abroad.</p>
