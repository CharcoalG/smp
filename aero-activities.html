						<h3>Zephyr-<a href="http://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/zephyr">www.aero.iitb.ac.in/zephyr</a></h3>
						<p>Zephyr is IIT Bombay’s annual Aviation festival that has now grown to become one of the biggest aviation festivals in India. What started off as an annual congregation of Aerospace enthusiasts and budding engineers of IIT Bombay, has now established itself as a pioneer herald of Aerospace for engineering students. It aims to provide a platform for students, scientists, professors and the industry to come together, showcase their work and exchange ideas. Lectures, workshops, competitions, exhibitions, Zephyr has it all, attracting over 3000 high­quality participants and many corporate partners every year.</p>
						
						<h3>Pratham - <a href="http://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/pratham">www.aero.iitb.ac.in/pratham</a></h3>
						<p>The IIT Bombay Student Satellite Project is a landmark project taken up by IIT Bombay students. The objective of this project is to make IIT Bombay a respected centre for advancement in Satellite and Space Technology in the world. The project aims at launching at least 5 satellites within the next few years. These Satellites could be test­beds for new technology that is being developed in the institute and also a method for space qualification.</p>
						
						<h3>Udaan</h3>
						<p>The students of the Department of Aerospace Engineering at IIT Bombay, have now revived the "Schools Outreach Programme". This new initiative called "Udaan" will create awareness about Aerospace Engineering among the school students. They are supported by Aerospace Engineering Association of the Department.</p>
						
						<h3>MSI - <a href="http://www.marssociety.org.in">www.marssociety.org.in</a></h3>
						<p>The Mars Society India is a part of a global community that shares a common vision of a manned Mars Exploration and strives to achieve this unprecedented feat in the coming years. The society was formed by a group of IIT Bombay students and hopes to develop into an epitome of space research in the country. We aspire to engage the students and public in general with the developments in space exploration through our projects and awareness programmes.</p>
						
						<h3>Rakshak - <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TeamRakshak">www.facebook.com/TeamRakshak</a></h3>
						<p>The objective of the team is to develop a robust unmanned aerial platform to be used for a variety of applications including, but not limited to
						<br>Conservation and Wildlife (Health monitoring of forest, Tracking poachers)
						<br>￼￼￼￼Supporting Search and Rescue operations for lost personnel
						<br>Providing relief measures in disaster stricken areas (Landslide, Floods, Earthquake etc.) 
						<br>Surveys and mapping of cities
						</p>
						
						<h3>AUV - <a href="http://www.auv-iitb.org/Web">www.auv-iitb.org</a></h3>
						<p>The team works towards participating at AUVSI Robosub Competition, which is held annually in July at San Diego, California. The competition is a platform for students to display their skills in underwater robotics and build a connection with industries working along similar verticals. The competition demands designing and manufacturing of an autonomous underwater vehicle that can perform predefined tasks.</p>
