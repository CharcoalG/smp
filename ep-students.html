						<p><i>Disclaimer : The mindsets described below will allow you to flourish as a physicist, and be happy and satisfied with your professional life. But you need not share this mindset to join our branch. Whether you are interested in engineering or the pure sciences, EP can cater to your needs. Our curriculum is very flexible offering a lot of electives, and there have been many students who went on to use the skills they learned as undergraduates in varied and interesting branches on the tree of profession. This article was written with the intent of ensuring that students of physics do not enter the branch with an unrealistic picture of the field and what it asks of its practitioners in mind, and get disillusioned by the reality. As far as we have  seen and learned, we have tried to present our picture of the reality of the situation. If you, like us, find it inspiring, beautiful, and nothing less than a wondrous thing that us puny humans are able to unravel so much about the cosmos with our intellect and our senses to guide us, and are motivated by the picture painted here, then by all means, join IITB. You will have a great time here!

								<h3>What is physics, and what does an undergraduate degree in it entail?
</h3>
								<p>The answer to this question is elaborate and can be viewed from a lot of differing viewpoints and perspectives. We will try to answer the question with relevance to JEE pass students considering an undergraduate education in physics. Well, most of you applying for, or considering physics, probably already know what physics is purported to be, a study of matter and its motion through space and time. This is accurate, of course. But not very informative. Because biomechanics is also a study of motion. One may, to be sure, say that biomechanics is physics, and one may get away with it, but an undergraduate degree in physics does not teach biomechanics. So, in the current context, we had best elaborate on this definition first. Physics as you may know, covers almost everything. 



<br>Well, so what do we know? First, physics is a science. This means that it is a study of nature, with the overarching theme of gaining more knowledge about the universe around us. This understanding has resulted in theories of the universe, sometimes elegant and beautiful, sometimes complicated, sometimes weird, spooky and confusing which explain a remarkable number of phenomena we find around us. What we choose to do with this knowledge is outside the purview of science (though a question worth asking oneself generally), and falls into various (interesting and challenging) other fields, the one most familiar to you being engineering. 

<br>As with any developed science, physics is vast in its scope and subjects. Not least is the fact that its definitional scope itself basically covers all tangible things (and some intangible ones too), since it is by definition the most fundamental field of inquiry into the natural world. 
(Though, in physics, any question can be taken to the playing field. This innate curiosity to understand makes us ask basic questions regarding our environment.
We with our human senses and technological advancements can probe the universe. This information is obtained via experiments. To make sense of this data, we come up with theories or hypotheses. Scientists will try to get a result which acts as a counterexample to the said theory, as such a result negates it.  This either would call for a modification of the theory or the consideration of a new theory. This process is then repeated to get better approximations to the truth.

<br>With this reasoning, it may be noted that undisproved theories are the best we can get to explain the world. It would be important to note that, as all possible experiments cannot be performed, what our theory suggests need not be what is the truth, even if such a thing exists; the existence of which is a matter of belief and comes under the purview of philosophy, beyond the realm of scientific inquiry.)

<br> And therefore, one needs a grounding in its basic concepts and paradigms, the applications of those paradigms, and even such seemingly trivial things as the terminologies used by physicists in the field. This is what an undergraduate physics education aims to give the students. The next few subsections shall be devoted to explaining, first, what kinds of thought-processes and outlooks that science in general and physics in particular require to be cultivated, how they are different from your experience so far as a JEE physics student, and how this might (might, mind you) affect your inspirations and motivations to pursue this field as a career. The following sections will give an overview of what fundamentals you will most likely be taught, and how they scale to career applications. Of course, an EP degree is more than just physics, and the final part of this article shall be completely about how, if your motivations are not aligned with a physicist’s way of life, this degree will be an excellent choice for pursuing engineering (and even non-engineering) applications, and what general skills it gives you that shall be useful for life. 
</p>
							<h3>Thinking Physics</h3>
							<p>To explain what kinds of paradigms you shall be exposed to as a student, you must first know what kinds of things physicists, do, on a conceptual level. To do this I shall freely use your existing knowledge of physics and explain with an example.

<br>Say there’s a scientist who’s found a new class of materials. Believe it or not, they seem to have zero resistance to electric current! The first thing that the community does is to test your claims. This is one of the things one does as an experimental physicist. This has to be done by avoiding biases, and so you begin by trying your hardest to disprove the result. You design experiments with the express aim of creating the exact same circumstances in the lab and then trying to measure resistance in various ways to varying degrees of experimental accuracy. This is the common theme between all experimentalists. The skills required are experimental design and a strong grasp of the fundamentals and along with, of course, a creative and open mind. And of course, statistics . Statistics are how we ensure our experiments are not falling prey to pitfalls that arise from some kinds of biases. So an understanding of what kinds of errors and biases might creep into your experiments is required.
  <br>But there are other kinds of experimentalists as well. Let me explain. Suddenly, a theorist has come up with a bright idea for explaining why  the material in question has zero resistance. And the reason why he’s convinced it’s a good idea is that it fits well with the rest of the theory of physics. It fits well with the conventionally known theory of electromagnetism, and mechanics, and so on. This is an important thought process throughout physics. Consistency with existing, proven( caveat on the word proven here) theory is the first step to checking the validity of one’s idea. To do this, one needs a strong grasp of the existing theory, and a bent towards mathematical thought, as all physical laws are expressed in mathematical form. Sometimes new mathematics needs to be created to verify these consistencies. The next step, of course, is for someone to step in and calculate (predict) what other consequences this theory has. This is another kind of theorist, a phenomenologist. He tries to calculate, compute* all sorts of things the new theory predicts, and what kind of measurable quantities it implies. 
 <br>Enter the other kind of experimentalists, who check the predictions of theories. This requires a powerful grasp of known theory, an excellent understanding of the theoretical calculations performed, and some ideas as to how to use known theory to measure these predicted quantities. After these checks are performed (usually by many groups all over the world, to ensure maximum certainty in results), the theory either gets proven and accepted into canonical science, or gets disproved and thrown out. (Not completely of course, as wrong ideas can be fertile ground for ideation). This has been how, historically, laws have been found and theories have been accepted for the causes for things.
 <br>* Recently, given the tremendous increase in technological capabilities and the complexity of theories to explain phenomena, there has been an increased use of computers to calculate the required quantities by certain theorists and experimentalists. Advanced simulation techniques or innovative algorithms are required, and thus, a sound programming mind and an understanding of computer architecture is something that is learned in the process.

<br>All physicists, be it theorists or experimentalists or both, need to have proper understanding of the theory and basics. To become one, thus, you’ll need to learn the existing framework of knowledge, which is where a degree in Physics would be useful.


<br>As you may have noticed, the topics covered while preparing for JEE aim at answering some of the fundamental questions around us. However, most of the science taught predates the 20th century. In the early 1900s, a few bizarre and counterintuitive ideas gave birth to fundamental theories which you might not have heard of, proved to be excellent descriptions of reality and therefore got established. Like Relativity and Quantum theory.  Most of the knowledge one will pick up in an undergraduate degree will involve the understanding and incorporation of these theories into a more sophisticated understanding of the world and into a modern framework of physical knowledge. 

<br>Moreover, almost all of these courses will be based on a mathematical grounding and a formulation that sets the theory up, brick by brick. In such an approach, one builds the theoretical framework from the basic assumptions/hypotheses one makes. This enables a concrete understanding what the scope of a theory lies and what it can predict, while giving you an excellent intuitive foundation in the building of new theories themselves, as you will learn the connections between physical concepts, postulates and their mathematical representations and will slowly become able to convert your ideas and physical intuitions into mathematical terms. This training is what contributes to the exactitude of physics.
<br>To give you an idea, in a course relating classical mechanics, students will revisit the familiar Newton’s laws. However, this time around, Newtonian mechanics will be pitched in a more structured language, wherein the theory can be generalized to a given system, contrary to the free-body diagrams one would use in which, one would write-down and solve each problem case-by-case. This particular language is used because it has proven extremely useful for both theorists and experimentalists to describe almost all of nature’s mysteries in, and work with for the purposes of more theoretical understanding or the calculation of measurable parameters.
