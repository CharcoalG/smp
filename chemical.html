						<p>Chemical Engineering is a field of engineering which uses physical or life sciences like physics, chemistry, biology and combines them with intensive use of mathematics and economics to process raw materials into substances which are useful, valuable or desired. Chemical engineering is a service-oriented field which serves to provide raw materials to other industries like FMCGs, while others are mainly product oriented. The discipline of Chemical Engineering has dramatically evolved in the past few decades and covers diverse fields ranging from oil and energy to pharmaceutics and biotechnology to semiconductors and electronics development. The domain of Chemical Engineers is enormous and encompasses synthesis, design and maintenance of large scale manufacturing processes.</p>
						<h3>Difference between a Chemist and a Chemical Engineer</h3>
						<p>Chemical Engineering is not the same as chemistry. Chemical engineers do study chemistry, but we apply engineering concepts so that the chemistry that chemists come up with, can be transformed into large scale manufacturing. As a matter of fact, chemical engineers focus more on physics and maths rather than chemistry. Chemical Engineers have now started moving from large scale processes to the exact opposite end of the spectrum: Nano and micro level analysis of materials, their structures and reactions. How this varies from chemistry is the fact that Chemical engineers also look at physical properties with chemical properties, thus providing a more holistic picture of processes

Traditionally, the study of Chemical Engineering majorly relies on 5 pillars of: </p>
						
						<h3>Thermodynamics  </h3>
						<p>Chemical engineering thermodynamics, considered to be one of the five “pillars” of the subject, builds upon the thermodynamics learnt uptil now. This is the science of heat and power. Governed by the popular 4 Laws (yes 4, not 3!) of Thermodynamics, this subject covers the study of these laws and their applications in mass and heat transfer, mixture properties, vapour-liquid equilibrium, azeotrope, refrigeration, etc. These find use in solving complex design problems encountered often in industrial applications. If you’ve ever wondered about your laptop’s heating problem, the efficiency of your air conditioner, or the performance of your bike’s engine, this course will definitely satiate you. The concepts covered include the laws of thermodynamics, the Carnot cycle, mass and energy transfer, fugacity, properties of mixtures, vapour-liquid equilibrium, azeotropes, etc. Using these, you can solve complex design problems encountered often in industrial applications.</p>

						<h3>Heat and Mass Transfer  </h3>
						<p>Heat and Mass transfer is the area of Chemical Engineering which determines quantity/rate of energy and material moved from one location to the other. Mass and energy balance is one of the key concepts one learns in the curriculum of Chemical Engineering and one can solve a variety of problems using this basic tool. Concepts like conduction, convection, radiation and diffusion are handled both from the theoretical aspect as well as practical.  Their importance is such that industrial grade equipment like heat exchangers, boilers etc. and complex processes like separation of materials can all be designed using just these fundamental ideas. </p>
						
						<h3>Fluid Mechanics  </h3>
						<p>Fluid mechanics is a field of general mechanics which deals with the motion of gas and liquid molecules. It is an essential part of chemical engineering as most of the Chemical processes occur in partial or complete fluid phase. ‘In a nutshell, it equips chemical engineers to understand and predict any kind of fluid flow - be it sulfuric acid in a chemical plant, or natural gas in a cross-country pipeline or even blood flow inside the human body!</p>
						
						<h3>Chemical Reaction Engineering  </h3>
						<p>Chemical Reaction Engineering is an integral part of Chemical engineering which deals with the design of a Chemical reactor. In fact, it is the one subject that differentiates Chemical Engineering from all other branches of engineering. It focusses more on the understanding, modeling and designing of reactors and the control theory that goes along, rather than the chemistry of the involved reactions. What chemists do on a lab-scale to produce chemicals, chemical engineers scale-up to an industrial scale; and this is the subject that equips them with the know-how to perform that. </p>
						
						<h3>Control Theory  </h3>
						<p>Control theory is as such a huge field in itself and is of major importance in Chemical Engineering. In chemical engineering, we majorly study Process control which concerns with the designing and implementation of devices that maintain the parameters of the system at certain pre-defined values. Process control is used extensively in mass production of products produced using a continuous process in the Chemical Engineering industry. This enables industries to automate the whole process with the system taking regulatory action for natural changes in process variables. </p>
						<p>Over the years, Chemical Engineering has evolved and has encompassed broader field of subjects which were not traditionally considered part of core chemical engineering, and are now becoming increasingly relevant.</p>
						
						<h3>Materials Science  </h3>
						<p>Materials Science is an active area of research and development in Chemical Engineering. The aspects of Materials Science from the point of view of a chemical engineer are discovering and creating materials which display desired characteristics needed for an application, designing and engineering systems to produce these materials in commercial-scale quantities and fabrication of revolutionary products using these materials in a cost-effective manner. Major material categories involve Polymers, Ceramics, Metals etc. </p>
						
						<h3>Biology    </h3>
						<p>Biology is associated with Chemical engineering in the form of Biochemistry and Biochemical Engineering. This field of study is concerned with the production of various chemicals, fuels (ethanol, butanol, biodiesel), pharmaceuticals etc. by the use of bioreactors which involves the use of biological organisms or molecules. A good amount of the study also deals with the common biological processes and their modelling. With a lot of work being performed in this field, biochemical engineering offers the potential for a lot of interesting research work.</p>
						
						<p>Apart from these, a major chunk of all the design process involves serious economic considerations as that is what decides if running a plant is viable or not.

</p>
						<h3>Economics    </h3>
						<p>No technically feasible design can be accepted unless it generates some economic value. Hence, the curriculum also involves rigorous concepts of economic analysis of Chemical Processes which are taken into account before the actual design of the plant. Optimisation is one of the most powerful tools that engineers use while designing their plants to generate the maximum revenue.</p>
						
						<h3>Dual Degree Programme   </h3>
						<p>Students with a CPI > 7 are given an option to convert to a Dual Degree (DD) Programme at the end of the second year. A DD Programme gives you a B.Tech.+M.Tech. degree in 5 years. DD students have to do one extra course every semester (which is easily manageable) and an yearlong project in their 5th year.
</p>
						<h3>Project Biosynth
   </h3>
						<p>Project Biosynth is an initiative of the department of Chemical Engineering aimed at providing practical training to students, along with conducting research in the field of producing biodiesel from vegetable oil. Students get to apply the concepts they learn in their classes on a semi-industrial scale plant and get hands-on experience on handling a plant on their own. Nearly everything is handled by a team of students who work under the guidance of a panel of professors, from designing components of the plant, conducting experiments and plant troubleshooting to organizing sessions and participating in competitions. It is a unique platform which involves collective effort of the entire team which will supplement your engineering knowledge and develop managerial skills, along with giving you a flavor of what engineering is like in the actual world.
