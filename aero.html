						<h3>Introduction</h3>
						<p>Aircrafts, satellites, spacecrafts are childhood fantasy of many people. Have you ever dreamt of creating aircrafts, rockets, missiles, satellites, helicopters or quad rotors? 
						Do space missions such as Curiosity, Chandrayaan excite you and make you feel that you want to be part of something like that? 
						If yes, then Aerospace at IITB is the place for you.</p>
						<h3>B.Tech Program</h3>
						<p>The curriculum in B.Tech Aerospace is designed to give you exposure to a wide varieties of field. Core courses in fields of Aerodynamics, Spaceflight Mechanics, Aircraft and rocket propulsion, Aerospace structures, Control theory, Aircraft Design, etc.  gives a B.Tech students an overall view of fields in Aerospace Engineering . Further by pursuing an Honors (taking extra courses) or undertaking  research project in the department (may be in collaboration with some defense or ISRO labs) or as a final year project, B.Tech students have opportunity to specialize to some extent in the area of their interests. In addition to theory courses, laboratory courses also make sure that the student gets hand on experience with wind tunnel experiments, aircraft engines, control instruments and structural analysis equipment.<br>
						<br>The main areas at Aerospace Engineering, IIT Bombay are:</p>
						
						<h3>Structures  </h3>
						<p>You must have seen lot of fascinating airborne bodies and must have wondered why these don't fail.  You may have heard about air crashes and also tall claims like dying in airplane has almost same probability as dying in bath tub. These make us wonder about stability and safety of aircraft. Structures not only take care of   forces acting on such bodies or deformation caused by them but also of all interactions taking place between these bodies and air around them. Structures  form most integral part of safety limits of any airborne objects. <br>
						<br>The basic sequence of courses includes introduction with Solid Mechanics which creates a link between what you have learnt in high school and what  you will be dealing with while designing or analyzing the structural components of Aerospace vehicle. This gives a basic introduction to structures. It  is followed by a course focusing on aerospace structures such as ribs, spar web, etc., in wings or theories such as thin-walled theory to analyze the Aerospace structures. Apart from these we also have many electives which you can take based on your interest like aero elasticity,  vibrations in  Aerospace structures,  composite materials etc. <br>
						<br>The theory courses are  supplemented with the laboratory courses which includes testing strength of different materials using different techniques, synthesizing composites used in aviation industry, etc.,</p>
						
						<h3>Aerodynamics</h3>
						<p>Since very beginning humanity has been fascinated by flight and we are no exception. Since childhood, you must have wondered what make these plane fly?  How can such heavy objects lifted?  Why birds fly in particular fashion or why racing cars are designed in way they are? You must have wondered about all fuss about sonic barrier and what's so special about it  While studying aerodynamics,  we try to understand forces on medium in which we have lived our whole life.  It's not just about those wind tunnel testing or computational fluid dynamics but also about all fluids - air, water,  blood etc. and their interactions with boundaries. <br>
						<br>It begins with a course on fluid mechanics which includes an introduction from simple topics such as Bernoulli theorem and covers the foundation such as potential flow concept necessary to understand the flow over airfoils. It is followed by a course on Aerodynamics which uses some basics from fluid mechanics to analyze the flow past airfoils. It also teaches some experimental techniques which are currently used to simulate flow over aircrafts. Apart from these we also have many electives which you can take based on your interest like computational fluid dynamics,  study of hypersonic flow, experimental method in fluid dynamics, etc. <br>
						<br>In addition to these theory courses there are laboratory courses to familiarize you about high speed experiments, flow over aerodynamic bodies and certain other experiments designed to test the theories which you have learnt in the courses.</p>
						
						<h3>Propulsion</h3>
						<p>Plane is sturdy,  plane can balance itself but how does it move at unbelievable speeds?  What powers such heavy bodies to fly at speed greater than even speed of sound?  Engines -  heart of every locomotive are very fascinating things.  Squeezing out every possible bit of thrust from fuel without compromising with safety is what separates leaders from pretenders. Here we study about engines which power our flying crafts. It basically involves an in-depth study of each and every component of engines and also talks about various types of engines such as turbojet, turbofan, ramjet, scramjet engines etc., <br>
						<br>The courses in propulsion starts with a basic course in thermodynamics, starting briefly with the basic concepts and quickly turning over to the practical applications of the theory to the engines. Then there is a course following it describing specifically each and every components of engine such as inlet, compressor, combustor, turbine, nozzle, etc., This will give you an opportunity to analyze any aircraft engine, may be the one which you see in your flight from your home to Mumbai. <br>
						<br>As with the other areas, propulsion is also supported by some laboratory courses through which you gain hands-on experience to some of the components of engine and also to use a small scale aircraft engine as a whole.</p>
						
						<h3>Controls</h3>
						<p>It involves all the instruments which are used to control aircraft, satellites, missiles, launch-vehicle or any other aerial vehicle. Now after having the structural body, aerodynamic and propulsion analysis ready, what is left is how to fly or navigate the aerospace vehicles from one place to another. It does analysis to transport an aircraft from one place to another, to launch a satellite in its orbit, to launch a missile and to make it continuously follow the target, to keep track of satellites and many more things. <br>
						<br> There are a number of theory and laboratory courses in this field which gives you an idea of the basics of control theory and slightly moves on to more advanced topics leading to an understanding of many real-life missions. The courses aims at analyzing the trajectory of a launch vehicle, the maneuvers of an aircraft, and designing the control systems which are used to control them. Basically, task is to develop brain for everything we can design. <br>
						<br> Apart from these, there are many optional courses or research projects which one can take to have in-depth knowledge or exposure to the current research in the field. </p>
						
						<h3>Honors in Aerospace Engineering </h3>
						<p>A B.Tech student is said to have “Graduated with Honors in Aerospace Engineering” when he/she has done a certain number of courses from the honors course list of the Department over and above the normal credit requirement. The exact details of the program are clearly specified in the Academic Rulebook of the Institute.<br>
						<br> The department has a fairly flexible honors program allowing the choice of a great number of courses for Honors requirements. All aero post graduate courses along with in-semester supervised learning projects and final year B.Tech projects are included in Honors list. </p>
