								<h3>Aakash Deshpande</h3>
								<p>I am aware that most of you would not be sure about what engineering entails. After three years in IIT, I'm not so sure myself! What is true though is that the theoretical aspects involved in JEE preparation do not cover engineering. If theoretical or practical problem solving is what you enjoy, CSE is probably the department which comes closest to your expectation.
<br>Our department has the name Computer Science and Engineering, and the 'Science' part well and truly has a pride of place before 'Engineering'. We have a great blend of theoretical science courses (eg. optimisation problems, data structures and algorithms etc.) and practical engineering courses (eg. Computer architecture, networks etc.), and the department allows you the freedom to choose between the two later based on your experiences. There is work being done in the department on any discipline or slice of Computer Science or Engineering you can think of. CSE thus allows you to work on an unsolved mathematical problem by yourself, or on intricate mega systems of scale in large teams.
<br>Almost any industry or project today relies on Computer Science or its principles in some way or the other. What you learn will be uniquely relevant and applicable to various core fields such as automation, finance, big data etc. Thus, the department opens the doors for you to a wide variety of opportunities, and the skills you learn will be forever valuable in any profession you choose for yourself.
<br>Lastly, we are a relatively new stream of engineering. We are thus growing rapidly, and have challenging and potentially disruptive issues to solve. If you feel you can contribute to the same, there is no better place to be!

								<p>I changed my branch to computer science and engineering after my first year. The curriculum of the department  is organized such that you learn theoretical CS such as algorithms, automaton theory in the second year, whereas third year focuses more on the practical aspects such as Compilers, Operating Systems and Networks. In that sense it prepares me for theory and systems both. Most of the courses are supported by coding assignments( labs ) to make students understand the topics thoroughly. However, it is said that the course load is heavier than others. When it comes to academic integrity, this department is very strict. If you love logic and puzzles, go for it.

								<h3>Amal Dani</h3>
								<p>CSE as a course is a perfect blend of theory and application. If you enjoy thinking critically, you will enjoy CSE. One point that needs to be noted is that CS is a form of science in itself, completely void of Math and Science you have been exposed too. The Theory developed in CS does require a good aptitude towards thinking abstractly and clearly. CSE @ IITB builds up on Theoretical CS in the second year and then exposes you to numerous systems courses. 
I would like to say that a very small fraction of the things you learn at IIT will be used directly, and your main takeaway is unarguably the problem solving skills you develop. CSE provided me the right direction to learn to analyze</p>
