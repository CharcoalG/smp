						<h3>Introduction</h3>
						<p> 
                OK, so for the next four or five years, your address will read something like this:<br><br>
                
                Room # ___, Hostel __<br>
		IIT Bombay, Powai<br>
		Mumbai — 400076<br><br>

		Here's to your first-ever stay in a hostel — definitely a first-ever of it's kind.
		Welcome to the hostel life at IIT Bombay!<br><br>
		Excited? You should be. Anxious? Just chill! Hostels eventually become the second home 
		to many of us here (or even the first home for quite a few). We will leave it to you
		to figure out. But we do like to give you some basic information to get you started. You can find the information in the pages under Hostel and Infrastructure.              	
                 		
              	<br><br></a>
              	Hope these pages answer some of your questions and give you a basic picture of the hostel

life. If you have any further question, do post in separate

pages (as comments) and we would be more

than happy to answer you. We look forward to have you

amongst us and hope that you look forward to it too.
<br><br> For more information, you can contact:<br><br>Sarthak Agrawal<br>General Secretary, Hostel Affairs (GSHA)
<br>Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay

						<h3>Facilities and Allotment</h3>
						<p><b></a>Hostel Allocation:</b></a>
		<br></a>
		All incoming undergraduate freshies are allotted 2 wings of hostel 15 and a wing in hostel 16 (for guys) and another wing of 
		hostel 15 (for girls).The other hostels have been around for some time, so do not expect fancy buildings and lavish, luxurious rooms.
		But Hostel 15 has been newly constructed and the rooms are pretty huge as comparedto other hostels, so consider yourselves very lucky! 
		Rooms are alloted on a twin sharing basis. But we assure you, it's not a dealbreaker. If it's any consolation, even second year
		and third year students are required to share rooms.
              	<br>
                The room allocation is random (roommates are usually from the same department and geographical location of JEE Test Centres). 
                You get hostel accommodation right when you reach IITB and the allocation list is available at the Main Gate and the Main Building.
              	<br><br>
                <b></a>Basic Amenities:</b></a>
		<br></a></a>
		Every hostel has a separate a mess (dining hall), a Computer Room, a gym, a TV, sports grounds and indoor games like Table Tennis,
		Carrom Board, Chess etc. These facilities can be availed of against your I-Card (which you all will be getting). Every floor in these 
		hostels has a washing room (including washing machines) and a water cooler. There's Internet connection in each room as well. Also, stationery and xerox shops are present in Hostel 15 
		and 16 for fulfilling basic requirements.
                <br>    <br>
                <b></a>Hostel/Room Change:</b></a>
                <br></a>
                The procedure of shifting rooms basically goes through the warden of the hostel through a written application citing the
		reasons for the change. Changing room partners is relatively pretty rare, not unheard though. I think it will be a great
		experience to have a new guy as a room mate which will eventually help you in making new friends which you'll
		cherish for your life.
                Though, definitely if both of you agree, it will make things easier.
                <br></a><br>
                <b></a>Rules for Visitors:</b></a>
                <br></a>

Parents are not allowed to stay in the hostels without prior

permission from the Hostel Coordinating Unit. Till 10 PM

female visitors to boys Hostels and boys wing in Hostel 15 and

male visitors to girls hostel and girls wing in Hostel 15 are

allowed after entering details in a register kept with the

security at the hostel entrance and after depositing the host's

I-Card. After 10PM, entry is restricted only till the common

areas — Mess, Lounge and Canteen. However, there is no

restriction on the in-time or out-time for a resident in his/her

hostel or any other hostel for students of the same gender.</p>

						<h3>Hostel Culture</h3>
						<p><b></a>Hostel Activities:</b></a>
              	<br></a>
		There are a plethora of activities that go around in the hostel which makes life fun. Lot of intra hostel events and
		competitions (amongst your hostel inmates) or practice for inter hostel (with other hostels) competitions in Sports and
		Cultural activites take place all year round. Also, a variety of festivals like Lohri, Holi, Ganesh Chaturthi, Jansmashtami,
		Dusshera, Diwali etc are celebrated in the hostels along with flag hoisting on Republic Day and Independence Day,keeping 
		the atmosphere in the hostels vibrant and full of life all year round. Do participate in whatever interests you, of course 
		after having devoted enough time to academics. It helps in breaking the ice and socializing with your batchmates and seniors.
         	<br>  <br>
         	<b></a>A grandparent-ish word of caution here:</b></a> It is too easy to get taken away by such activities and the sense of freedom that 
         	college gives you. We advise you to live your passion but exercise discretion. You have heard too much about time management 
         	already, so we'll skip the lecture, but you know what we mean.
         	
         	<br></a>
                <br><b></a>Council Structure:</b></a>
                <br></a>
		
		The hostel council is divided into Cultural (Cult), Maintenance (Maint), Mess and Sports. Each of the council is headed by
		Hostel Councillors (or Cos - generally third year students or thirdies) with Hostel Secretaries (Secys - second year
		students or sophies) assisting them in the administration of the hostels. All cultural programs and activities are the
		responsibility of the Cult Council; likewise all sports events are managed by the Sports Council. The Mess Council looks
		after mess and canteen while the Maint Council ensures proper working of the common areas and the hostel maintenance. 
		All the councils are supervised by the Hostel General Secretary (GSec - a fourthie or fifthie = big daddies). To oversee 
		hostel funds and the Student Council, every hostel has a Hall Manager and a Warden and to assist them, there are Warden Nominees.
		Every hostel also has an Alumni Secretary to maintain cordial relations with the hostel alumni. Computer Secretary (Comp Secy) 
		takes care of the Computer Room and Internet connection problems while Technical Secretary (Tech Secy) manages the Technical
		Events at hostel and institute level. More details on the specific functions of each council member would be conveyed to you 
		once you reach here.
                <br></a>
              	<br><b></a>Hostel Spirit and Wing Culture:</b></a>
              	<br></a>

		This is perhaps the best part of the whole deal. With time, all

		inmates become the part of one big family. For nothing else

		but the sense of belonging, you are expected to support and

		cheer for your hostel and other inmates in inter hostel events

		(this includes hooting for your hostel during the much

		coveted freshie orientation programmes, of which you will

		come to know in due time :P ). Blocks of some 10-15 rooms

		constitute a wing in each hostel and your wingmates

		(wingies) will be your immediate support group in more ways

		than one. We cherish the time we have spent with our

		wingies and we hope you do so too. Your wingies might be

		people from very diverse backgrounds but do not let that

		hinder interaction in any way. In fact, use it to your

		advantage. You would go with your wingies on intra hostel

		volley and cricket matches, treats (birthdays, crack acads,

		mentor's placement et al), treks, tours, hang-outs etc all the

		time. At the same time, socialize with other hostelers -

		batchmates and seniors alike - all the time. Also, ragging ,simply, is a strict no no! Strict actions (expulsion from IITB) are taken against those found guilty.

						<h3>Computer Usage at IITB</h3>
						<p>	Right from the first lecture, you will hear professors say that

Lecture notes or other stuff have been uploaded on their

websites or on Moodle. What remains to be tackled is, how

exactly are you supposed to access the internet? Here, we

provide you some basic information.

All hostel rooms have a LAN Port which you can use to

connect to the IIT Bombay network and to the Internet,

provided you have a computer. The institute provides us proxy-less access to the internet.
You need to open any browser and go to this URL- <a href="http://www.internet.iitb.ac.in">www.internet.iitb.ac.in</a>,
type in your LDAP id and password and you are good to go.
In case, the proxy-less access gives you trouble,
you will need to set the IP

Address and some other parameters before you are able to

do that. Ask your Hostel Computer Secretary for help. You

can also visit web.iitb.ac.in for some details (if you can). 
<br></a>

In case, proxy less internet gives trouble, to access the internet, you will need to change the proxy

settings of your browser. Go to Tools > Options or Edit >

Preferences if you are using Mozilla or goto Internet Options

(in case of Internet Explorer/Chrome) and look for Network
Settings ('Advanced' tab in Mozilla). Select 'Set proxy

manually' and enter netmon.iitb.ac.in in the text field

provided. Enter 80 for the Port. Enter these settings for all

protocols (HTTP, FTP etc) and then go to the 'No proxy for'

field. Enter localhost, *.iitb.ac.in there and you

are done. Alternatively, select 'Automatic Proxy

Configuration URL' and enter

<a href="http://www.cc.iitb.ac.in/autoproxy.pac">www.cc.iitb.ac.in/autoproxy.pac</a>. The second

method may not work every time and everywhere so it's best

if you stick with the first.
<br></a>
Once you have set the Proxy, you will be asked your user-
name and password when you try to access any site. Here

you will have to enter your LDAP id (the one starting with 15

(for 2015 - your batch), with the general form 15xxxxx). 

You will mostly be given a printed sheet with these details.
<br></a>
You can use the Hostel Computer Room for accessing the

Internet (after undergoing the Hostel orientation). The Hostel

Xerox shop owner also sometimes lets you surf the Net on

payment basis. Check with the shopkeeper for details. The

Xerox shop is also the place where you can get notes

copied/printed, buy recharge coupons and other things of

daily use. Apart from these two, there are other places

from where you can access the Internet.
<br></a>
<br></a>

<b></a>OSL (Old Software Lab) -</b></a>
<br></a>
You will be doing all your CS101 labs here. Apart from the

few hours per week that you get as part of your lab timings,

this lab is not accessible (most of the time slots are occupied

and usually some other course would be running a lab

session). The lab also closes depending on the timing of the

last course and is not accessible 24X7. Your lab timings

would be just enough so that you can do your assignments.

You will not get time to study/do things apart from your CS

assignment in the OSL.
<br></a><br></a>
<b></a>Department Software Labs -</b></a>
<br></a>
Depending on which department you're in, you may have

access to a mediocre to very good computer lab. The NSL

(New Software Lab) is simply the department lab of the CSE

department. It is accessible 24X7 and is wifi enabled. The

Mechanical Department also has a Software Lab that is

accessible to all its students any time of the day or night.

The Department labs are very good places to study as they

are air-conditioned and quiet. Depending on your

department, you may or may not have a wifi network

accessible to students. Some departments do not have

many computers/irregular lab timings. So this option may not

work for you if you happen to be among the unlucky ones.

Even if your department does have a good computer lab that

is open all through the night, you may find it a task to walk

about a kilometre from your hostel to get to the Academic

Area where all the the departments are located.
<br></a><br></a>
<b></a>Academic Area/Library -</b></a>
<br></a>
The Library, LHC (Lecture Hall Complex) and all the LCHs,

LCCs and LCTs (Lecture halls, classrooms, and tutorial

classrooms respectively) are wifi enabled. You can stay back

after a class to browse the Internet or download lecture
material on your phone/tablet/laptop. There are also a few

PCs in the library but they are meant to be used for issuing

books and it isn't polite to use them for other purposes for

more than a few minutes.

						<h3>In and around IITB</h3>
						<p> Apart from shopping for the essentials, you will sometimes

feel like hanging out, relaxing and having fun. On this page

you will find information about just that. Of course, it is not

exhaustive, but it does give you a head start. Mumbai is a

huge city and it's yours to explore!
<br></a>
<br></a><b></a>Daily needs</b></a>
<br></a>
For the most basic of amenities such as toothpaste,

toothbrush, pens, soaps and other such items (which one

should use daily), one can go to one's canteen or Xerox

shop itself . Another alternative would be the Hostel 12 shop

which stocks almost everything one would need and more-
from slippers to stationery to biscuits and towels, with

servings of Computer RAM and MP3 Players on the side.

One can also go to Haiko or D-Mart in the Hiranandani

Complex for these. Alternatively, the shopping complex at

the Y-Point Gate can also take care of most of your needs.
The YP market has a dry cleaner and a tailor as well, just in

case.
<br></a>
<br></a><b></a>Stationery and Books</b></a>
<br></a>
For notebooks, bags and most stationery items including

journal sheets and rulers/set squares/protractors, there is the

Co-operative store located on the MB ground floor near the

library. 

For buying books, we have a shop called Book World on

campus on the ground floor of the Gulmohar Building where

you can get discounts on course-related books. Alternatively,

you could go to Popular Book Store at YP. Or you could buy

second hand books from the Jay Ambe bookshop outside

Main Gate, next to Mahavir.

Most of your hostels would have printing and xerox shops of

their own. If you're looking for coloured or A3 sized printouts,

H8's printer shop would be the place to be.
<br></a>
<br></a><b></a>Cellphone connections and credit</b></a>
<br></a>

For recharging your cell phone credit account, H3, H8 and

H12 in particular have shops where you can get almost all

kinds of top-ups or recharge cards. Alternatively, if you have

a debit card and a vodafone account, you could also log on

to vodafone.in and recharge your account online. It is also a

good idea to check out all the schemes available for different

connections before settling on a cellphone service provider.

There will be multiple temporary stalls inside the institute for

first few days of the session, otherwise Airtel and Vodafone

connections are easily available at Main Gate. Reliance has

a store in Hiranandani near Subway. Vodafone has a store

near the Delphi Building (next to the Cafe Coffee Day outlet).

In case of pre-paid connections, you need to submit a photo

ID card and documents to prove that your address is what

you have written in the form. If you do not do it within 2-3

days of buying the SIM, it will be disconnected.
If you need passport sized photos for any forms (you should

always keep some handy) you can go to the Navrang Photo

Studio (Galleria) or the one right opposite Main Gate and get

them clicked.
<br></a>
<br></a><b></a>Restaurants and Eateries </b></a>
<br></a>

For fruits and all, Y-point and Main gate Markets are good

options. For bananas in specific, your hostel canteens are

sure to stock them. Fresh fruit juices are also available at the

Campus Hub which is next to Hostel 5. Apart from juices and

ice creams, this places are also a haunt for fruit chat, sev

puri, dahi puri, pav bhaji, chhole bhature et al.

In case you're hungry and low on cash and in the academic

area, you can think of heading over to the Staff Canteen

located next to the library or the KReSIT Canteen located at

KReSIT. Gulmohar Cafe and Gulmohar restaurant located at

(where else but) the Gulmohar Building are places to catch a

bite whenever you get bored of mess food. These cater to

both vegetarians and non-vegetarians.

Right outside Main Gate, you have Laxmi - the pure veg

restaurant. For a quick bite, you have Monginis located bang

opposite Main Gate, which is your best bet for cakes and

other bakery items as well. In Hiranandani (HN), we

recommend Subway and all those eating joints in Galleria's

food court, in case you don't want to burn a hole in your

pocket. If you do feel like burning a hole in your pocket, there

are a lot of options in and around Hiranandani. Many multi-
national restaurant and cafe chains, Theobroma, Starbucks

to name a few, have also recently opened their outlets in

Hiranandani. Away from Hiranandani, R-City, a mall in

Ghatkopar, has the best of fares for veggies and non-
veggies both with Bhagat Tarachand, Urban Tadka and

Rajdhani being highly recommended restaurants. Then

there's a Pop Tate's on the other side of the lake which has

good Italian and continental fare. And if you're in the mood

for decent Punjabi food, think of Happy Singh at Sakinaka.

Matunga's the best place for South Indian fare and Dadar for

authentic Marathi cuisine.

Amongst the regular ones, HN has KFC, Dominos, Pizza

Hut, CCD, Aromas, Baskin Robbins and so on. There's a

McDonald's at Nirmal Lifestyle, Mulund.

There are a few exclusive dessert parlours next to Subway -

Naturals, M.O.D, Cocoberry, Theobroma, Love &

Cheesecake etc.
<br></a>
<br></a><b></a> Entertainment</b></a>
<br></a>

Should you feel like catching a movie, we suggest early

morning shows (before 11 am or 12 noon, depending on the

place) at Nirmal Lifestyle, Mulund or R-City, Ghatkopar or

Cinepolis at Neptune-Magnet Mall, Bhandup, since these

come relatively cheap, even on weekends. Huma Adlabs

can be an option but be warned that the seats are not so

great and the ticket rates are almost always pretty steep.

Apart from these, if you're interested in plays and all,

Prithvi's the place to be. The place has a discount for

students on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and tickets for

students cost just eighty bucks. How do you book your

tickets? Go to http://www.bookmyshow.com

You can also go to Hiranandani for GoKarting, there's a

circuit called Hakone, just 5 minutes in an Auto. It will cost

you about Rs. 140 to Rs. 250 depending upon the number of

laps you choose. Also you can go for bowling, situated in

Dreams Mall, Bhandup. Priced at Rs. 100, it is the cheapest

in Bombay. R-City Mall also has bowling and air-hockey.

Generic Shopping

For all branded wear in just one place - Linking Road,

Bandra. As for trendy clothes, head out to the many malls

like Nirmal Lifestyle (Mulund), RCity (Ghatkopar), Westside

(HN, Andheri, RMall), Inorbit (Goregaon), Shoppers Stop

(Bandra, Andheri, Nirmal Lifestyle), Huma (Kanjurmarg),

Infinity (Andheri) and any other mall. 

In and around town

The art galleries in town, specifically the Gallery of Modern

Art, the Jehangir Art Gallery and the Chhatrapati

Shivaji/Prince of Wales Museum (all located near Colaba

Causeway) are worth a dekko. In case you're in the mood for

trekking, Karnala bird sanctuary (beyond Panvel) and the

Sanjay Gandhi National Park(Borivli) can serve as good

starting points.

<br><br>
<b>
Public Transport @ IITB </b>
<br>
You must have seen a few green or blue buses plying on the streets when you entered the hallowed portals of IITB. 
These, as you probably already know, are called TumTums.
These are the unsung heroes of transportation in the institute. You have probably already paid Rs. 1000 for a semester pass and can utilize the services as soon as you get your ID card. Otherwise, you can always buy TumTum coupons for your parents / friends at the main Gate, at SOM or at the Y Point Gate. The coupons are priced at Rs. 10 and entitle you to two journeys (of any length).
The service starts in the morning at 07:00 and runs till 11:00 at night. A few tum tums run at night too but their frequency is much lower. On the upside, you can request a night TumTum to halt no matter how far you are from a scheduled stop. The frequency of TumTums is high just before classes start and just after they end. You will soon find yourself complaining about the frequency of the service, but the TumTums are probably a boon to the institute, considering the public transport scene a few years back. Our advice, jump on them anyway! The ubiquitous Murphy's Laws apply to TumTums too, with all TumTums always going in the direction opposite to your intended direction of travel.
Other popular means of transportation are cycling, walking and the auto rickshaws. There are two cycle repair shops on the campus, one at Y Point and the other, next to H8. Remember that maintenance of your cycle is crucial, especially in Mumbai’s rainy weather. A sturdy lock is also a good investment.
 
<br><br>
<b>Public Transport in Mumbai</b>
<br>
The public transport system is highly developed and is used by millions of people every day. The chief modes of transport available in the city are the BEST Buses (AC and non-AC), trains, autos and taxis.
The BEST buses generally run for comparatively smaller distances within 2-3 suburbs, though you might consider hopping on to that bus which takes you from one end of Mumbai to the other during the peak hours when the trains are filled choc-a-bloc. An android app called ‘m-indicator’ can often come handy when it comes to getting info about anything related to transport, from local maps to BEST bus routes to auto rickshaw fares. Google maps is another popular app which is often found useful while travelling.
The Local Trains in Mumbai are by far the cheapest, fastest and most convenient way to get around the city. The Mumbai suburban railways are primarily broken up into 3 lines—the Central, Western and Harbour lines. Refer to Google Maps to see how these lines cover the entire megacity. An important thing you need to know is that there are 2 types of trains—slow and fast. The slow trains stop at all stations, whereas the fast ones don’t. The “fast” train stations are marked with a larger font on all railway maps. The nearest station from the campus is ‘Kanjurmarg’. Note that fast trains do not stop here.  
Tickets— You can purchase a coupon booklet from the counter. If you find yourself having to travel by train often, you could go for the Smart Card. You could purchase one at any ticket counter by giving a minimal refundable deposit.
Autos and taxis can be flagged from any part of the city. Unlike other cities, Rickshaw-wallas and Taxiwallas strictly charge you by meter (we make no claims as to whether the meter has been rigged or not!). Share autos/taxis are also available at some places that charge lesser.

mentor, the police and the hospital, in that order

						<h3>Accommodation in and around IITB</h3>
						<p>[UPDATE]You can check which hostel you have been allotted with this link: <a href="http://gymkhana.iitb.ac.in/hostelRooms/">http://gymkhana.iitb.ac.in/hostelRooms/</a> </p>
						<p>
					Here's what you should know if you are playing host to some

Guest for overnight stays:
<br></a>
IIT Bombay has 2 Guest Houses - Jal Vihar (the Old Guest

House) and Van Vihar (the New Guest House). The rooms in

both are equally luxurious (in spite of what the name

suggests) with AC rooms, TV, Internet Connection, attached

Toilets et al. Rooms are for two but unless there is a rush,

can be booked for one. The charges per night for parents

are Rs. 1000/- for double occupancy and Rs. 600/- for single

occupancy while for other guests, they are Rs. 2000/- and

Rs. 1200/- respectively. The charges include the morning

cup of tea and the newspaper. To book rooms, you need to

get a form from the first floor office of Jal Vihar filled and duly

attested by the Head of your Department (HOD) after

approval by your Faculty Advisor (or Fac-Ad). It is usually

just routine work, though might take upto a day depending

upon the availability of your Fac-Ad and HOD. The filled form

must be deposited at the Van Vihar office. No advance

payment is required. Room charges are to be paid, as
applicable, upon check-out. We suggest you to book well in

advance to avoid any rush.
<br></a>
 Since the Guest Houses have limited capacity and IIT

Bombay plays host to many dignitaries from time to time,

rooms can also be booked in Hostels. However, in hostel

rooms, you have to make arrangements for mattresses and

other basic things on your own. Mattresses might be

available for rent with the Hall Manager office. We suggest

you look around in your wing and you might find someone

who can lend you an extra mattress. The charges for the

room (without mattress) per night for parents are Rs. 100/-

while for other guests are Rs. 300/- For booking, forms are

available with the Hostel Coordinating Unit (HCU) in the

Main Building (MB) or you may print the attached PDF.

After filling out the particulars, submit it to the HCU along

with a photocopy of your I-Card. Take the copy of the

approved form from the HCU to the Hall Manager of the

alloted hostel and you are done. You may later collect the

key from the Hall Manager office a day prior to the arrival of

guest. In emergency situations also, guests can stay in the

hostel rooms after entry in the Guest Register kept with the

security at hostel entrance. The formalities can be completed

on the next working day.
<br></a><b></a>Note:</b></a>
<br></a>

1) The HCU or Hall Manager office is open from 9am to 5pm

(with lunch break from 12-2pm) except on weekends and

holidays. On Saturdays, the office is usually open in the first

half. Plan accordingly.
<br></a>
2) During the orientation period, neither of these might be

available due to rush. It is advisable to make alternate

arrangements.
<br></a>
<br></a>  			      			      			
Although there are Guest houses inside IIT to accommodate

guests, the rooms are rarely available.

						<h3>Medical facilities</h3>
						<p>The first and foremost thing - you all will get a medical

booklet that asks you to fill a few details about yourself and

get yourself vaccinated against certain diseases. It's all for

the record and your own benefit- so it is highly

recommended that you get a dose of all the vaccines

mentioned (in case you havent already). Its always better to

do this than being put through the misery of missing college

life while you recover from illness. (For all the vaccination

related details , see below)
<br></a><br></a>
At IIT Bombay there is a hospital (we fondly call it the

"hospi") to take care of any medical trouble you may manage

to land yourself up into. There is a 24hour ambulance facility

for all students. For calling a ambulance you can call 1110

from any internal phone placed at security guard’s desk in

every hostel. All of these facilities including prescription

medicines are free for IIT students, covered by the annual

insurance that you pay with the fees in the odd (Autumn)

semester. This insurance also covers you for an amount of

close to Rs 50,000 in medical expenses in case you need to

be referred to an outside hospital. Even the cost of
      		
medicines purchased from a chemist and/or charges for lab

tests/other radiology work can be reimbursed when

prescribed by a doctor from the IIT hospital (or from a

hospital recognised by IIT - the list of which can be found at

http://www.iitb.ac.in/hospital/index.html

There is an OPD in the hospital that runs on all days (only till

1pm on weekends) from 8am to 6pm on weekdays. Also, the

emergency ward handles medical cases outside these

hours. The hospital also has Pathology and X-Ray facilities.

There is also a facility for physiotherapy to deal with

fractures and other such ailments. If there happens to be a

serious case and an MRI/CT scan is required, the IIT

hospital refers you to the nearby Hiranandani hospital which

is less than a kilometer away. Specialist doctors from HN

hospital also come to the IIT hospital (on an appointment

basis). And, for emergencies that IIT hospital cannot handle,

you are rushed to this hospital. 

The medical history of each student is dutifully recorded in a

file everytime you visit the hospital and filed on a shelf there.

Everytime you visit the OPD, you will need this file. In case

you choose to keep it with you at your room (which is alright

too) don't forget to bring it along when you come to the

hospi.

If you fall sick and are advised rest by the doctor and hence

cannot attend lecture(s) or write examination(s), the doctor

will give you a "pink slip". This slip is the only trusted proof

that you were officially sick and advised rest. No other

reason for missing an examination is entertained. In case

you missed an endsem, you will be given II grade. That

means that you are eligible for an re-examination. To get

yourself a re-examination, show this pink slip to your

professor and he will let you have one. This system is

unremittingly strict and a recommendation from any other

doctor or hospital will simply not do.
<br></a><br></a>
<b></a>Vaccination</b></a>

There are primarily 4 vaccines which you need to have

yourself vaccinated with during your stay here. These are :
<br></a>

1. MMR
<br></a>
2. Typhoid      		
<br></a>      		
3. Chicken Pox
<br></a>
4. Hepatitis A 
<br><br></a></a>
You can either get them administered from your personal /

family / local doctor in your hometown .In this case you need

to show a medical proof ( certificate of vaccination ) of the

same when you fill the medical booklet. You can attach a

xerox copy of the same while submitting the booklet. In case

you fail to do that , the IITB Hospital arranges vaccination

camp once every month in the Autumn ( Odd ) semester

(July - November) which generally lasts around 3-4 days

where you can get yourself vaccinated. You will be paying

for the vaccines then and then and get yourself vaccinated.

Please post any more vaccinated queries below. 

You will invariably end up visiting the hospi - be it for visiting

friends who are recovering or getting your health on track.

Worry not, the hospi food is known to be better than the

mess food and the staff is kind-hearted and cheerful. So

while we hope you never face those days, take home a few

sweet memories if you do.              	<br></p>
