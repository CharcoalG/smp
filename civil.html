						<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
						<span style="font-family:calibri"><p>Civil Engineering is the field that reaches
						out far more than what you imagine it to be. A civil engineer is responsible for
						the design, construction and management of buildings, bridges, highways, airports,
						tunnels, water supply networks, waste water treatment, transportation in a region
						and many more things which play an important role in the development of a place
						and add on to what a place really looks like. <br><br>
					
						 Nowadays, Civil Engineering has also found its importance in various fields that
						 were never thought to have Civil Engineering application, e.g. Structural analysis 
						 of human body, organs and cells, transportation of RBCs/WBCs in blood vessels etc</p>
						</span>
						<h3><span style="font-family:calibri"><strong>B.Tech Programme</strong></span></h3>
						<span style="font-family:calibri"><p>The civil engineering department at IIT Bombay is 
						ranked among the top universities around the world. The curriculum is designed to give
						you an exposure to a wide spectrum of related fields. Core courses in Structural Mechanics,
						Solid Mechanics, Fluid Mechanics, Geotechnical Engineering, Transportation Engineering and
						Remote Sensing help give a BTech student an overview of all areas in CE department.
						Further, by pursuing an Honors degree or undertaking the final year project, BTech students
						have the opportunity to specialize, to some extent, in the area of their interest. 
						 <br><br>Laboratory courses make sure that the student gets hands on experience, and together with
						 field visits (visits are not a part of the curriculum per se, yet are conducted often),
						 they supplement the theoretical knowledge gained in the classroom.<br><br>
						 The objective is to create future leaders of industries, policy planners and administrators of infrastructure systems.</p>
						
								<h3><strong>Subdisciplines</strong></h3>
								<p>Broadly, the programme can be divided into the following subdisciplines:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Structural Engineering</li>
									<li>Fluid Mechanics</li>
									<li>Hydrology</li>
									<li>Remote Sensing</li>
									<li>Geotechnical Engineering</li>
									<li>Transportation Engineering</li>
									<li>Ocean Engineering</li>
									</ol>
							<h3>Structural Engineering </h3>
								<ul>
									<li>This field is for those who see the big structures around them and wonder how one could possibly build them. The programme has been designed to give you in-depth knowledge about everything that goes into constructing buildings, bridges, etc. </li>
									<li>The initial courses focus on building up the basics so that you can tell at the microscopic level how various forces in solids work. Later courses will help you analyse the effects these forces might have on the behavior of a structure as a whole. </li>
									<li>This knowledge will impart enough understanding in order for the students to apply it towards design. Analogous to human beings, a structure cannot stand without a proper skeleton and the design courses are meant for learning how to design that skeleton.</li>
									<li>Under this branch is also included the research to predict how good are different materials in construction. One deals with interesting stress-strain & behavioral analysis in materials like bamboo, steel, concrete, timber, rubber pads etc. Field visits offer a great deal of practical knowledge. Brilliant researches & development requirements in India make it the most demanding field of civil engineering.</li>
									</ul>
								<h3>Fluid Mechanics </h3>
								<ul>
									<li>This field deals with behavior of fluids all around us. The course structure is designed to cover: <br>
									  <ol>
										<li>Fundamentals of fluid mechanics - classification and important properties of fluids</li>
										<li>Fluid statics and dynamics</li> 
										<li>Flow through closed pipes & open-channels</li> 
										<li>Basics of lift and drag forces on objects moving in a fluid which serves important criteria for the design of aircrafts</li> 
									  </ol>
									</li>
									<li>The slightly advanced course deals with open channel flows, momentum and energy of fluids.</li>
									<li>Fluid Mechanics also forms a back-pillar of two other major fields including Mechanical Engineering and Aerospace Engineering, and thus covers widespread practical information. </li>
									<li>The courses under Fluid Mechanics strengthen the concepts of forces, pressures, energy, momentum etc. as well as understanding of mathematical concepts of integration and differentiation and 3D coordinate geometry and hence serve a challenging ground for enthusiasts.</li>
									<li>What one learns during the course finds numerous applications all around including designing pipe networks for townships or even for a completely new city, designing canals to help in irrigation.</li>
									</ul>
									
									<h3>Hydrology </h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Hydrology as a branch is quite different from fluid mechanics. It considers water as a very important natural resource and deals with its effective use and management.</li>
									<li>The course structure deals with:  <br>
									  <ul>
										<li>Tools and methods for predicting rainfall, peak flows and how different fundamental measures are taken to save water as a resource </li>
										<li>Planning, Construction and Operation of various types of water retention structures such as dams, barrages and weirs</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>Hydrology involves mathematical concepts of probability and regression analysis which help us conclude about patterns and make predictions.</li>
									<li>One also learns about the management of water resources by studying canal routing, reservoir planning etc. Climate modeling, ground water conservation and other water-harvesting procedures find their ground in this field.</li>
									</ul>
									<h3>Remote Sensing</h3>
									<p>Remote sensing at the very root means sensing the properties of an object from a distance (remotely). This simple process helps us obtain information which can be put to myriad uses. The field has evolved to great extent in the past few decades and includes such areas as: </p>
								<ul>
									<li>Geographical Information System (GIS) or geographical surveying - wherein students get to learn the art of projecting an area of land into digital models and analyzing them to explore the various possibilities of use the land could be put to. </li>
									<li>Global Positioning System (GPS) – a well-known system. Students learn the applications of GPS in various fields (other than the location services on mobile phones) including how it is one of the most valuable input sources for GIS.</li>
									<li>Astronomy - position of earth and locating places on earth using astronomical tools forms the centralized theme for it. </li>
									<li>Satellite imaging - This area deals with the use of satellites to photograph the earth and later image processing in order to obtain valuable information about atmospheric conditions, land cover (vegetation, topography), etc. This is also the same thing which makes popular Maps services (like Google Maps) come into existence. Students get to learn and explore how satellites in space really help us track down millions of problems.</li>
								</ul>
								
								<h3>Geotechnical Engineering </h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Geotechnical engineering is the study of soil and its properties. The foundation of any structure rests on soil and so it is very important to know the properties of soil. Since soil is a natural material and we cannot change its composition, we study classification of soil to categorize them into different groups. The area also discusses various tests done on soil and design of some underground structures. We also learn about various techniques to improve soil properties. </li>
									<li>The learning in this is divided in two compulsory courses in different semesters and later, there are a few advanced level optional courses as well, if a student wishes to further his knowledge in this field. </li>
									<li>IIT-Bombay proudly owns the India’s largest geo-centrifuge facility in its geotechnical laboratory.</li>
									<li>Wondering about Palm Islands in Dubai would be a right point of thought at the time!</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Transportation Engineering</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>This group of courses deals with exploring about not just vehicles on road but also all the management and planning that goes at back.</li>
									<li>With traffic issues becoming more severe day by day and with the advance of bigger lingering problems of congestion, fuel consumption, long rush etc., the need of the hour is to indulge in good technology and knowledge to get appropriate practice and adequate measures in implementation & this is what this branch prepares you for.</li>
									<li>One learns about how roads/rails/airports are designed, what goes into planning the flow of vehicles, how concerns of transportation problems are analyzed and dealt with using brilliant software and technologies. </li>
									<li>Learning simulations of how things are realized in real-life forms an integral part of the learning. </li>
									<li>The course involves topics from different fields including mathematics, statistics, computer science, designing etc. and thus tends to expand the scope of learning and application in wider areas of life.</li>
								</ul>
								
								<h3>Ocean Engineering</h3>
								<p>The curriculum exposes the students particularly to the study of coastal and ocean infrastructure including port, dock and harbor structures, coastal protection works and offshore oil platforms, navigation. Included in the course works are the latest concerns on ocean environment, changing coastal laws and sea policies. After completing the necessary course, the students, rather now engineers, will be able to efficiently handle planning, analysis and design of engineering infrastructure at the coast as well as in the open ocean and also look after their construction, management and operation.</p>
							
								<h3>Honors in Civil Engineering</h3>
								<p>A worthwhile undertaking which also awards an additional degree in the transcript, it is meant for those who wish to explore more in Civil Engineering. A student can take 24 extra credits (~4 additional courses) in the department to dive into deeper depths of Civil as a branch of life. Courses being offered as honors reflect advances in all the branches of civil engineering and are provided in good number for flexibility in choosing the ones matching one’s interests.</p>
								
								<h3>Dual Degree in Civil Engineering</h3>
								<p>A student can convert from a 4 year BTech program to a 5 year dual degree, at the end of 3rd year. After the additional year of academics, s/he will be awarded 2 degrees, BTech and MTech, instead of just one (BTech). The department has decided to offer dual degree programs in all the M.Tech. specialisations, viz., Transportation Systems Engineering, Geotechnical Engineering, Water Resources Engineering, Structural Engineering, Ocean Engineering and Remote Sensing.</p></span>	</div>
