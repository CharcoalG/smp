						<h3>Antariksh Bothale, Mechanical Engineering Dual Degree (2011) </h3>
						<p>As someone who enjoys breadth of learning, I opted for Mechanical Engineering during JEE Counseling because I found it to be fairly broad-based among all the viable choices available to me, and the general course content felt interesting. As a dual degree student, I’ve spent a lot of time with the department, both due to an increased number of courses and because of the DDP (final year Dual Degree Project).</p>

<p>It might be almost a cliché among all the alumni accounts you'll read in this section, but I really did enjoy my academic life at IITB. There were plenty of good professors and interesting courses in the department, and I started liking even tiny things (such as quizzes late in the night) which had felt weird in the beginning :). Earlier, the department used to be more TFE (Thermal and Fluids Engg.) heavy, but that has changed in the last few years, so, you can expect to have larger variety of courses in the other sub-fields too. There's also plenty of active student-managed projects that you can be a part of if you find them interesting—from FSAE to BAJA to autonomous underwater vehicles, Robocon and the like. There's plenty to keep you occupied if you find Mechanical Engg. interesting and fun.</p>

<p>For most people, their undergrad years are some of the most formative parts of their life, and I am no different. There’s a lot that IITB teaches you—whether it be in lectures or outside. The other day, I was trying to solve JEE exam questions from this year’s paper (the one you aced). Although my JEE preparation days are, thankfully, 8-9 years in the past, I could solve most of the questions using first principles that only seem to have been strengthened during my time at IIT. I realized that, especially in Physics, I had a much deeper understanding of most of the topics because of my training as a Mechanical Engineer. </p>

<p>Most department at IITs have associated reputations. I don’t know what the current ‘fashion’ is, but I found Mech to be a good department to be in, and I didn’t find substance in the slight bit of fear-mongering I had initially been subjected to about how it was a difficult department to be in. While it’s true that I have since moved to a different field and industry (I did an MS in Computational Linguistics after working in Management Consulting for a year and now working in the software industry), I had a great time in the department during my IITB time. </p>

<p>Like most other things, how much IITB gives you depends on how much you are willing to take out of it. There is a lot that this place has to offer, and I hope that you will use all the resources here as best as you can.</p>
						<h3>Chinmay Deo, Mechanical Engineering Dual Degree, Minor in Electrical Engineering (2013) </h3>
						<p>While deciding my branch I had spoken to a few people who had gone to IIT, and being from Bombay, I decided that I wanted to study in IIT-Bombay. That along with the fact that I really liked the Mechanics & Thermodynamics section from the JEE syllabus, and was told that Mechanical Engg would be closely related to it. Later on, the field turned out to be completely different from what I thought it would be, but in a good way. Good freedom in terms of choosing courses & electives, the opportunity to do research in your undergraduate years, approachable professors and some of the smartest classmates you can find!</p>
						<p>At IIT Bombay, I was focussed on my academics, since for me that was one of the main reasons I had entered IIT and I enjoyed most of my courses. As a dual degree student, I had the opportunity to work on a year long research project as my masters thesis in the field of control systems[a mixture of mechanical & electrical engineering]. Some of the exciting areas in Mechanical Engineering are Product Design/Product Development, Micro & Nano engineering - studying the mechanical properties of micro/nano-level structures as products get smaller every year, Robotics(includes large doses of electrical engineering and computer science as well). In the Mechanical Department @ IITB, students can expect exposure to a wide variety of general engineering subjects, access to some top quality professors. Also - mechanical engineering courses are famous for their 9pm-10pm quizzes on a few nights every week :)</p>
					<p>What you end up doing after IIT is largely a function of what you do in IIT. What you have done before entering IIT doesn't matter at all. At IIT-B, you can be assured of access to a huge variety of opportunities, both in terms of jobs(either at multinationals, large indian companies or startups), research(in labs, colleges, or external organizations), further degrees(MS/PhD/MBA) or even entering fields not related to science at all(public policy, government, non profits etc). I am currently working with Avanti - an enterprise that tries to get more low-income kids into top quality engineering/science colleges(such as IIT-B) through running our own programs across the country. We are currently working with over 1200 students across 12 locations. We are currently growing our organization multiple times over every year and the expansion process, and spreading education to students across interior India is what really excites me!</p>
					<p>Apart from the fact that I have met my closest friends in IIT, I think I have learnt a few important things from my time here - 

    <br>1. Always be humble - all of you will have this realization as soon as you enter IIT and meet people who are better than you in almost every field imaginable(both in and out of the classroom)
    <br>2. Use the next 4/5 years to try as many new things as possible without fear of failure - you will never get this freedom again. Learn to fail at things - most people entering IIT have only experienced success for all of their life. 
    <br>3. Do not be blindly influenced by what other people say - There will always be people around you telling you to do certain things, or to do things in a certain way. Listen to their opinion, consider it, and then do what you feel is right
    <br>4. Your opinion about most things will change, as will your likes/dislikes - you, your parents, and your friends should be prepared for it
    <br>5. What you get from IIT is purely dependant on how much you involve yourself in things - be it academics or extra-curricular activities. If you love engineering, you can build racecars and travel the world. If you love drama you can do a play at the best theatres in the country. If you love singing, you can perform in front of a crowd of thousands. If you love research, you can work with the best universities & professors in the world. There is no ceiling!</p>
