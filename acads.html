						<h3>Introduction</h3>
						<p>There is a high probability that you have spent the last two or three years appreciating the beauty of physics, chemistry and math and toiling over a hoard of problems meant to drive concepts in. 
						Your entry to IIT Bombay marks a paradigm shift in the way you view academics. <br>
						<br> Contrary to what you may have heard through the grapevine, academics do form a central aspect of your life at IIT Bombay. 
						Here, you are provided with a basic structure to understand your major and you get to mould your curriculum and churn the maximum out of it. You could choose to explore a breadth of courses from various streams 
						and provide a unique perspective to your major, or you can dive to the depth of the field and become the authority in it. You can contribute to the vast body of theoretical knowledge or bridge the chasm between theory 
						and real world applications. <br>
						<br> The faculty members here strive to expose you to the latest technological developments in the world and engage in tackling all kinds of problems. While they are going to grade you on courses, 
						they are also open to any projects you initiate and will always be willing to discuss your ideas. The experience of studying with the best minds of the country, steps up the challenge a notch. <br>
						<br> It is all about how you use the resources innovatively and carve a niche for yourself.</p>

						<p> This site is meant for you, the future entrants into the IITs, to get an idea of what the different branches actually do and what engineering/sciences really involve. 
              	We, the students of IIT Bombay, have prepared this material describing the programmes offered at IIT Bombay based on our experience here. 
              	The description of each  programme is focused on how it is structured at IIT Bombay and the nature of similar programmes offered at other colleges might be different. 
              	To get an in-depth description of all the departments and programmes, do check out the individual websites of each IIT. 
              <br>		<br> Please note that this information is <b>NOT</b> officially endorsed by IIT Bombay and merely represents the opinions of the students who have contributed to it.
              <br>		<br> If you have any doubts, please feel free to post your questions on the respective department pages. If you have any other general questions you can post them here. 
              <br>		<br> Humble Appeal :
		Countless students have fallen bait to the practice of blindly following the cutoffs of the previous years and ended up hating the branch that they choose. 
		We hope YOU, the future IITian will make judicious use of this initiative and make an informed choice.</p>
		
		<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
		<p>
			<b> I have secured rank XXXX in JEE. Which branch/IIT should I opt for? </b><br>
			Congratulations on your selection! We understand that this is an important and hard decision to make, but only you can make a judgement for yourself. 
			However, you should keep certain factors in mind while making this decision. Of course, these are all very subjective and we have only tried to give a basic guideline.<br>
			
			<ol>
				<li>Area of Interest<br>
				Our first advice would be to carefully read ALL the information provided on this website and the individual department websites about the curriculum and course structure of ALL branches.
				This should help you match your interests to majors available. However, it is common for first year students to have misconceptions about branches, it is true for all of us and we usually laugh about it after 4/5 years. 
				Engineering Physics is not all about mechanics problems, Computer Science does not only involve learning new programming languages and can involve heavy math, Electrical Engineering is not only about transistors or circuits. Try to 
				gather as much information as you can and speak to people in the department to verify if your understanding of the department is in fact correct.
				</li>
				
				<li>Condition of the Department<br>
				You should also try to find out how a particular department is faring in the institute of your interest. Good indicators would be the strength of faculty members, research work that goes on in the department, how the courses are conducted,
				how are the experimental facilities, external activities/competitions that take place in the department. 
				</li>
				
				<li>Future Prospects<br>
				This is by far the factor that is unduly given the maximum amount of weightage to. However, you should understand that there is always plenty of scope in every department and how you perform after 4/5 years in purely contingent on you. 
				You will find people in all departments working at variety of pay scales. Your undergraduate years teach you a lot about what you like as an individual and every department has a range of things that you might end up liking. And if you do, 
				you will be able to find a way to put it good use. 
				</li>
				
				<li>Other external factors<br>
				These would include the amount of exposure you get in a certain institute, the kind of people you get to interact with, the facitities at the institute, the flexibility that the institute provides to pursue non-academic interests etc. Again, these are all very subjective.
				
			</ol>
			

			<br><b>How do I choose between a B.Tech and a Dual Degree program?</b><br>
			
			The Dual Degree students are required to complete 1 extra course per semester (from a list of electives according to your specialization) from the second year and complete a Dual Degree Project (like a Master Thesis). It provides a more rigiorous treatment of your major but with an extra load. 
			The B.Tech program gives a little more flexibility as you don't need to restrict yourself to courses of a particular specialization and you can gather a broader perspective, if you like. However, you can also cover more breadth in the Dual Degree Program (by taking additional courses) 
			or go into depth in the B.tech Program (by doing Honors), it is up to you. <br>
			Dual Degrees do have a restriction that they can take up minors only if they have a CPI greater than 8 as they already have to do an additional course every semester. <br>
			Dual Degree programs are being recognised by universities abroad and you can directly apply for a PhD program after graduating with a Dual Degree. It also gives you an extra year to try out different things (both within your department and otherwise).<br>
			You can switch from a DD to B.Tech after the first year and from B.Tech to DD up to the 5th semester, with the criteria varying per department. <br>
			
			<br><b>Can I change my branch after entering IIT Bombay?</b><br>
			The option to change your branch is made available to students at the end of the first year. No such option is available in the subsequent years except the change from B.Tech to Dual Degree in the same branch. The criteria for branch change depends on the number of people who apply
			and largely depends on your Cumulative Performance Index (CPI) at the end of the first two semesters. We do not advise people to take up a branch at IITB relying on Branch Change later. <br>
			
			<br><b>Should I opt for branch ABC at a different institute or a branch I do not prefer at IIT?</b><br>
			Please refer to the answer to the first question. You should use the same factors to make a judgement.

						<h3>First Year Courses</h3>
						<p>Many of you might be interested in knowing what courses you would do in your first years' experience. 
              	It will be good to have a basic idea of the courses. 
              	What follows has been written based on the past 3 - 4 years.
It may so happen that the course content/instructor may change thus affecting many parameters. 
However, it will definitely give you some idea of what you are going to be taught. Comments about difficulty/strictness etc. should not be taken 
at face value and should be interpreted qualitatively at best. </p>
	
<p>Also, do not exert yourself in order to bring all of these text books with you - if you already have some, get them along by all means. 
In any case, the institute library has enough copies of these and there are quite a few second hand book stores in and around the institute which shall serve your purpose quite well. 
For your benefit, we have named the books relevant to each course in italics. 
Though these books will certainly help you understand the course, these might not be the textbook for the course. The book referred for a course highly depends on professor and the professors are different for different batches of students. 
So, if you have these books don't hesitate to bring them along otherwise buy them if the instructor recommends them.  </p>

<p>In each of your first two semesters, you will be taking 4 theory and 2 'lab', i.e. practical, courses.
In addition, most theory courses also have weekly 'tutorial' sessions, where you are divided into batches of ~40 students. A TA (Teaching Assistant) solves problems from the tutorial sheets 
(usually distributed in advance) during these 1-hour sessions.
For theory courses, 6 credits mean that you are expected to devote 6 hours per week for that subject (3 hrs lectures/tutorials + 3 hrs self study). Likewise for 8 credits (4 + 4).</p>
						
					</div>


<div class="box" id = "practical">
						
						<h3>Practical English Training</h3>
						<p>At IITB, the medium of instruction is English. We understand that some of us are from non-English backgrounds and would benefit if useful practical concepts can be taught, revised and practised.
						<br>To this purpose, ISMP conducts a British Council organized course for the freshmen. This course aims at providing you all the tools you require to break the language barrier and communicate in English with basic fluency.<br>
						<br>English Resources:<br>
						For those of you who wish to revise their concepts, we also have a resources bank coming up on this website. You can learn, refresh and discuss your concepts here!</p>
					</div>


<div class="box" id = "ugcurriculum">
						
						<h3>Undergraduate Curriculum</h3>
						<p>The undergraduate curriculum at IIT Bombay is modelled after the curricula of the best universities in the world, and is truly one of the most exciting and versatile in India. It blends flexibility with academic rigor, allowing students to take up some courses of their own choice, both within and outside their departments, apart from completing a certain minimum requirement of “core” courses.<br>	
<br> Here at IITB, the academic year is divided into two semesters, each lasting about 16 weeks. Each semester, you have to complete a certain number of credits/courses. Based on your performance, you are assigned a grade at the end of each course. The weighted average of your grade points for all the courses in a particular semester gives your Semester Performance Index (SPI). The weighted average of these SPIs gives your Cumulative Performance Index (CPI). CPI gives an overall impression of your academic performance and plays an important role in course/project allotment in later semesters, not to mention internships and placements.<br>	
<br> <i>A word of caution:</i> According to a recent ruling, a professor is allowed to set any minimum attendance requirement (usually 80%) for his course. If a student does not meet this specific requirement, the professor is fully within his/her rights to award them an ‘DX’ grade, in which case they will have to repeat the course. So do make it a point to be regular in all courses. In case a student is unable to achieve the minimum cut-off marks in a particular course they fail and receive an FR grade. <br>	
<br>Exceptional performance in a course can even earn you the highly valued AP grade in that course. Awarded rarely to more than 1% of the class strength, it is a feather in a cap worth striving for.<br>	
<br>The most exciting part of the system, for the academically-inclined, is the concept of Minors & Honours. Starting from third semester, you will be allowed to take up courses in any discipline that you might happen to be interested in (say, Electrical Engineering or Biology). You can earn a Minor in specific discipline by doing a certain number of extra courses in that discipline. Be warned that registration for Minor courses, particularly in ‘popular’ departments, is very competitive, with a seat-cap on all courses. If you are serious about your Minor ambitions, then be on your toes and maintain a good CPI right through your degree programme! <br>
<br>Dual Degree students, in addition, must have a CPI of more than 8.0 and zero backlogs in order to be allowed to register for Minor courses, as they already have an extra ‘DD elective’ course to complete in addition to the core courses, from second year onwards. The B.Tech students too have the option of completing a certain number of these elective courses in their own department and earn a ‘B.Tech. with Honours’ degree. Honour courses are highly recommended, they’re usually a lot more interesting and fun than the regular ones! <br>
<br>Finally, if you happen to have any backlog(s), you will have to repeat (and this time around, hopefully pass) the course(s). Typically, one-tenth of the class fails every course.</p>

						<h3>Academic Ethics</h3>
						<p>IIT Bombay has been a leader in technical education in the country and has been recognised internationally for the calibre of its students. IIT Bombay aims to produce leaders and innovators that can positively impact the society. Academic Integrity is one of the core values propagated by this institute to achieve this aim.. All the students are expected to adhere to an Academic Honour Code and maintain a high standard of conduct. <br>
						<br>Cases of academic dishonesty are dealt with seriousness. If you are found giving a proxy in class, you are liable to receive a ‘DX’ grade which will require you to repeat the course. A case of a copied home assignment can attract a grade penalty. Copying during exams can have graver consequences, ranging from an ‘FR’ (a fail grade requiring repetition of the course) to added community service. Repeat offences can also lead to suspension. You can find a detailed list of offences and punishments here.<br>
						<br>Students are encouraged to report cases of academic malpractice. A fair, healthy learning atmosphere can only be fostered with the active participation of all students.</p>
					</div>

<div class="box" id = "facad">
						
						<h3>Faculty Advisor: Your Friend, Philosopher and Guide </h3>
						<p>Faculty Advisors (FacAd), as the name suggests, are professors from your respective departments, who will help you out in making academic decisions. FacAds keep track of your progress and will guide you properly. Each semester, the courses you take will be finalized only with the consent of the FacAds. Changes in the program, such as dropping of courses, withdrawal from a semester on medical advice etc., can be effected only with the consent of the FacAd.
The FacAd might play a limited role in the first year. But as you grow older in the IIT system, you might have to make some tough decisions regarding coursework and programmes in order to choose a career path suitable to your interests. If you intend to change your branch/specialization after the 1st year, your FacAd is the right person to approach. You may also have to seek the FacAd's permission to participate in inter-collegiate competitions.
The FacAd is an important link between you and your department. Do not hesitate to talk to them regarding any academic issue.</p>

<div class="box" id = "theory">
						
						<h2>Theory</h2>
						<h3> CS 101 - Computer Programming & Utilisation (6 Credits) </h3>
						<p>
						CS101 intends to give you a crash course in programming (using C++) and general computer use, including the UNIX environment. 
						Those with a background in programming will find this course pretty easy. However, those who are new to computers or programming will have to put in some extra effort. 
						The course is interesting though, and if you devote some time and practise, you won't find it difficult. Attend all your labs and solve homework problems diligently (=on your OWN), for best results. 
						You do not need a personal computer to do well as there are sufficient resources available for practice in campus.<br>
 						<br>We would also like to add that programming is something that you might need to use in almost all spheres of academia, so it is important that you take this course seriously. 
 						You will find it relevant in many ways in the years to come.<br>
						<br>Content:<br>
						Unix shell, primitive types, arrays, expressions, control statements, functions, basic I/O, structures and classes, applicative problems.
						<br><i>The book followed by most course instructors is Cohoon, C++ Program Design: An introduction to Programming and Object-Oriented Design</i>.<br>
						<br>N.B. You will be working in a UNIX environment, so brace yourself for that.</p>

						<h3> MA 105 - Calculus (8 Credits) </h3>
						<p>
						One of your seniors said, 'I thought I knew Calculus, until I encountered epsilons and deltas in MA105'. 
						As you will soon realise, MA105 gives you a taste of calculus quite different from what you have seen during your JEE days. 
						The course content can be broadly divided into Single variable Calculus, Multi-variable Calculus and Vector Calculus.<br>
						<br>The course begins by plunging you into the nitty-gritties of limits, continuity and differentiability, covering theoretical as well as practical aspects of concepts you've been so far trained to take for granted. 
						You will continue with Integration (including surface and volume integrals) and then jump into Multivariable Calculus and Vector Calculus, meeting several Greek letters on the way. Divergence Theorem, Stokes' Theorem 
						and a few others will finally end the course with Ã©lan. <br>
						<i>The book followed here is written by Prof IK Rana, a professor of our institute and you will find it in campus book stores only. B. Thomas and R. L. Finney, Calculus and Analytic Geometry should also be of help.</i><br>
						A word of caution from experienced seniors - Do not take this course lightly. At 8 solid credits and a pretty strict grading system, this course can easily pull down (or push up) your CPI quite significantly.</p>
   
 
						<h3> CH 107 - Physical Chemistry (4 credits) </h3>
						<p>
						This half semester course comprises of two parts: Quantum Chemistry and Thermodynamic<br>
						<br>Quantum chemistry will start with elementary operator algebra. You will be introduced to the Schrodinger equation and Born interpretation of the wavefunction. Thereafter, the course will deal with how the Schrodinger equation can be solved (exactly!) for a Hydrogen atom. These solutions will be interpreted as orbitals. Concepts of structure, hybridization and bonding follow naturally from the orbital picture.<br>
 						<br>Thermodynamics will start off with the introduction to Potential Energy Surfaces. The concept of activation barrier and computation of reaction rates with this knowledge is touched upon. Then, the steady state approximation, its validity and limitations will be taught. The course will also touch upon concepts of pre-equilibrium, equilibrium and other related thermodynamic quantities.<br>

						These books are classics in Physical Chemistry. If you have already bought one or more of them while preparing for JEE, don’t forget to carry them along.</i></p>

						<h3> CH 105: Organic and Inorganic Chemistry (4 credits) </h3>
						<p>
						As the name suggests, CH 105 is an introductory course for both organic and inorganic chemistry. The organic portion looks at organic chemistry from a molecular orbital approach. This theory is applied to explain features like the reactivity of functional groups, conjugation, and aromaticity. JEE concepts of isomerism are extended. Reactions involving important mechanisms are taught, including reactions of the carbonyl functional group, and other synthetically important reactions like oxidation-reduction.<br>
						<br>The inorganic portion starts off with a part very familiar to JEE students- periodic trends in atomic properties. The Ellingham diagram used in metallurgy is explained. The transition metal properties are explained with a focus on their magnetism, complex formation and the bonding theories used to explain complex formation. Bio-inorganic chemistry and catalysis are briefly touched upon.<br>

Clayden, Morrison and Boyd and Solomons are the most commonly prescribed books. Mechanisms and concepts need to be well understood to be able to solve the papers.<br>
						 
						<br> Inorganic:
						<ol>
						<li>J. D. Lee, Concise Inorganic Chemistry, 4th Edition, ELBS, 1991</li>
						<li>Shriver and Atkins' Inorganic Chemistry, 5th</li>
						<li>D. D. Ebbing, General Chemistry, Houghton Miffin Co., 1984</li>
						</ol>
						A thorough reading of JD Lee and Shriver/Atkins is usually essential and sufficient for the course.</i></p>

						<h3> PH 108 - Electricity & Magnetism (6 Credits) </h3>
						<p>
						PH 108, fondly (?) referred to as 'E-Mag' begins with a quick introduction to a couple of coordinate systems you probably have not used before, viz. Cylindrical and Spherical. 
						Mastering the use of these systems along with the familiar Cartesian system will make this course, as well as MA105 and CH103, a lot more 'peaceful' for you. 
						After rushing through the fundamentals of Vector Calculus, you study electric and magnetic fields in turn (both in vacuum and in material media) using the tools that you've learnt: this constitutes the bulk of the course. 
						Some other topics may be touched upon if time permits. <br>
						
						<br><i>Your Bible for this course will be Electrodynamics by D. J. Griffiths, a clear and concise text, with the occasional splattering of good humour. 
						The problems in this book are of a level slightly higher than that of the course, but you should give them a shot nonetheless. </i><br>
						 
						<br>The grading for this course is relatively harsh: solve your tutorial sheets regularly if you seek a decent grade!</p>
						
						<h3> PH 107 - Quantum Physics (6 Credits) </h3><p>
						The course begins by teaching Einsteins theory of relativity and Lorentz transformation. 
						At first the ideas seem abstract but after going through the text a couple of times you get hold of the concepts. 
						The course then moves on to different aspects of quantum mechanics like Heisenberg uncertainty principle, compton effect, schrodinger equation in 1d and 2d.
						Towards the end of the course, a brief glimpse of quantum statistics and quantum analysis of solid state is given to the students.
						Though most of the topics may sound familiar, there will be plenty of stuff for you to learn. However, if you devote some time, this course won't be a major difficulty.<br>
						
						<br><i>Modern Physics by Kenneth S. Krane should be sufficient in guiding you through.</i></p>
						
						<h3> MA 106 - Linear Algebra (4 Credits) </h3><p>
						Linear Algebra is the study of systems of linear equations as well as vector spaces and linear transformations - two things you probably haven't heard of yet. MA 106 is a half-semester course that crams a lot of theory as well as techniques into a very short duration. The abstract concepts might take some time to set in, so spend a while on them. You will have to be on your toes at all times. There are several deep concepts that require and deserve some thought, though you should focus primarily on the techniques that are taught in this course. If you put some time into this course, though, it can actually be quite likable. Keep in mind that Linear Algebra has widespread engineering applications and you will need to look back at it several times, so you might as well take it seriously.<br>
						
						<br><i>Book : E. Kreyszig, Advanced engineering mathematics and/or another one again written by Prof IKR himself. You will find it when you get here.</i></p>
						 
						<h3> MA 108 - Ordinary Differential Equations (4 Credits) </h3><p>
						This course is pretty straight-forward. You will start with some material you have already seen for JEE, and then proceed to additional concepts and techniques for solving Second Order Differential equations of a few types. You will then move on to Improper Integrals, Laplace Transforms and Convolutions. This is a half-semester course and so runs pretty fast, but is easy to handle, so make sure you know your stuff well. The course content is highly relevant to engineering students of all disciplines so do pay attention as you will need to put these tools into practice pretty soon.<br>
						
						<br><i>Books : E. Kreyszig, Advanced engineering mathematics and B. Thomas and R. L. Finney, Calculus and Analytic Geometry </i></p>
						
						<h3> BB 101 - Biology (6 credits) </h3>
						<p>
						BB101 is an intoductory course on biology, The course is divided into 3 modules, each taught by a separate instructor:
						 <ol>
						<li>The first module deals with building quantitative models for biological systems. This portion of the course is very mathematical and is unlike any biology you have been learnt so far. You will be taught estimation on the cellular scale, thermodynamics related to biological systems and a variety of other topics which you would not expect to see in a biology course. <i>Reference: Physical Biology of the Cell by Rob Phillips, Jane Kondev, Julie Theriot, Hernan G. Garcia</i></li>
						<li>The second module is a more traditional approach to biology, dealing mostly with cell division, genetics and evolution. <i>Reference:  Campbell Biology by Jane B. Reece, Lisa A. Urry, Michael L. Cain, Steven A. Wasserman, Peter V. Minorsky, Robert B. Jackson</i></li>
						<li>The third module comprises of physiology of the nervous system and the heart, and applications of bio-engineering in modern times. <i>Reference: Textbook of Medical Physiology by Guyton and Hall</i></li>
						</ol>
						</p>
						 
						 
						<h3> XX 1XX - Department Introductory Course [DIC] (6 Credits) </h3><p>
						Nothing much can be written about this because each department has its own DIC. You will take it in the second semester (departments with two DIC’s will do one each semester) and it will be your first departmental course. The DIC’s are:
						 
						<br>Aerospace - AE 152 (Flight Mechanics 1) & AE 102 (Data Analysis and Interpretations)
						<br>Chemical - CL 152 (Introduction to Chemical Engg.)
						<br>MSc. Chemistry - CH 104 (Chemistry 2)
						<br>Civil - CE 102 (Engineering Mechanics)
						<br>Computer Sci - CS 152 (Abstractions and Paradigms)
						<br>Electrical - EE 111 (Introduction to Electrical Systems) & EE 112 ( Introduction to Electronics)
						<br>Engg. Physics - PH 105 (Modern Physics)
						<br>Mechanical - CE 102 (Engineering Mechanics) & ME 102 (Data Analysis and Interpretations)
						<br>MEMS - MM 152 (Materials and Technology)
						<br>Energy - EN 110 (Energy Engineering Fundamentals)<br>
						 
						<br>Books : Differ for each DIC. Look up on the department websites, under courses. You should be able to find a list if you need.</p>

						<h2>Labs</h2>
						
	<h3> PH 119 - Physics Lab (3 Credits) </h3><p>
You'll be made to do a series of 9 experiments (out of a possible 12) over the course of the semester. Manuals are not allowed while you perform the experiments, so remember to read up on your experiment well in advance (this does not mean the lunch break before the lab) and to finish writing the preliminaries (Aim, Apparatus, etc.) on your journal sheets. 40% of the weightage goes to the endsem, where you'll be randomly assigned an experiment to perform.</p>
 
<h3> CH 117 - Chemistry Lab (3 Credits) </h3><p>
You shall do 8 interesting experiments during the semester. Unlike Physics lab, you will be allowed to take manuals with you and will have to do all written work in the Lab itself. However, you will be expected to read up on the experiment and allied topics beforehand. There is usually an oral viva on the day of experiment. The Insem work will have 80% weightage and the written quiz 20%. The quiz is easy if you have read your experiments well. Don't forget to put on your shoes and lab coat unless you want to go back all the way to your hostel (the Chemistry dept. is the farthest). The lab coat you used in your school will serve the purpose. So do get it along if you still have it.</p>
 
<h3> ME 119 - Engineering Graphics & Drawing (5 Credits) </h3><p>
Here, you will learn about Projections of lines, planes, solids, sections and intersections and surfaces of solids on a 2-D surface (in your case, the Half-Imperial Drawing Sheet). You will also do Orthographic and Isometric projection and some bit of Machine Elements. Those who take this subject in +2 level find it a cakewalk, but it has a moderate difficulty level. We will leave it to you to decide. Be prepared to study on your own as the lectures might baffle you. Trying to answer the questions yourselves (vis-Ã -vis misusing the Xerox shop) will help you a great deal. <i>The prescribed book is Engg. Drawing by N D Bhatt</i> which is quite sufficient for the course, if at all you read it. 80% weightage is allotted to the sheets that you will complete in-semester with an additional 10% to three AutoCAD assignments. The remaining 10% constitutes the end-semester exam – so consistent performance throughout the semester will matter more here. You might be required to put it in a little extra effort as you may have to practise the given drawing problems in rough well in advance before the actual lab session.</p>
 
<h3> ME 117 - Workshop Practice (4 Credits)[2] </h3><p>
This course gives you a brief exposure to working on five different trades: fitting, pattern-making, the lathe machine, shaping and welding. Fitting and pattern-making involve working with metal and wood respectively, and are the only trades that require physical exertion of any kind. The lathe and shaper are machines that do most of the work for you; your only responsibility is to accurately and regularly take measurements. The welding section requires you to melt a single straight line into a slab of metal, but it is surprisingly easy to mess up, especially because any and all mistakes are permanent. There is a quiz towards the end of the semester, with multiple-choice questions (one or more correct answers - JEE nightmares alive!) based on material covered in the weekly lectures and the prescribed text-book Elements of Workshop Technology, Vol. I & II by S. K. Hajra Choudhury & Others (in two volumes that only a handful of legendary seniors have been through and survived to tell their tale). You will also have an end-semester practical exam, where you are randomly assigned a trade.</p>
<p>
 
Remember to wear covered shoes to all workshop sessions!</p>

<div class="box" id = "nso">
						
						<h2>NSO/NSS/NCC</h2>
						<p>As a part of your first year curriculum, you are expected to participate in either a sport (NSO), or the NCC or community service through NSS. 
Bear in mind that this is a part of your curriculum​ and thus, you will be graded on it (Pass or Not Pass). That's why we have posted in here along with your First year Courses. 
Usually, you can Pass by attending your sessions regularly (yes, the 80% attendance rules applies here as well) and by doing modestly in the final test. 
But there have been cases in the past of students receiving a Not Pass grade because of not taking it seriously. Early in the semester, you have to fill in your choices and so here's a little info about each of them. 
Choose only what you want to do because you will have to attend the sessions for two semesters (you cannot change once the allotment is final and the sessions start)</p>

<h3> National Sports Organization (NSO): </h3><p>
The NSO programme encompasses a wide number of sports, the complete list of which can be found in your preference form. 
Typically, classes are held twice a week in the evenings for about an hour and a half and at the end of ￼your first year, the final exam is conducted for each sport.
As these classes are held only for first year students, they give an excellent opportunity to pursue any game you like (see Note: 2 below). 
But, as it is with all good things, conditions apply. With a batch of more than 800 students, it is impossible that every student gets a chance to be a part of the sport of his/her choice. 
You fill out 2-3 sports which you would like to play and subsequently, when the semester starts, trials are held for each sport. Look out for the posters on the Hostel Notice boards or listen for them on the Hostel PA system in the evenings. 
Failure to turn up for the trials doesn't entitle you to another chance in most cases, so be on time! Also, for sports like Badminton, Tennis, Table Tennis, etc please carry your equipment with you at the time of your trials. Try borrowing if you are unequipped.
Once you are done with the trials, it's all fun! NSO gives you an opportunity to form a group with whom you can continue playing in your senior years for recreation. For those who have been a part of their school sports teams, here's the road back! Use it to shed off the rust and have a real shot at getting into the Institute Team!
Note:
1) There might be cases where the CS101 labs(usually held in the evenings) might clash with your NSO classes. You can talk with your CS101 instructor and have your lab days shifted.
2) For most sports, you are expected to know the basics. It's not the best place to start if you are a novice and want to learn the sport.
3) NSO also has an option for music - vocals or the chance to learn an instrument e.g. the tabla, the keyboard, the guitar and the violin.
</p>
<h3> National Service Scheme (NSS): </h3><p>
NSS IIT Bombay is the IIT Bombay chapter of National Service Scheme institutionalized by Government of India under the Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports as part of its public service initiatives. 
The aim being to inculcate social welfare thoughts in students and undertake actions reflecting the same. NSS IIT Bombay carries out its activities with the help of more than 250 student volunteers under four departments viz. Educational Outreach, Events, Green campus and Vikas
<b>Educational Outreach</b> helps NGOs in educating underprivileged children. Freshmen volunteers go to NGO centres on a daily basis and teach kids to help them build a brighter future <br><br>
<b>Events</b> is the most versatile department as far as serving the society is concerned. It has activities ranging from Cloth Collection Campaign to solving the problem of food wastage in hostels to working for the welfare of construction workers on campus <br><br>
<b>Green Campus </b> focusses on conserving greenery of the institute which is under a constant threat from the ever increasing infrastructural needs. The department maintains its own nursery through which it carries out plantation and protection of saplings <br><br>
<b>Vikas</b> works on ideation and realization of sustainable ideas. It works on ideas for the betterment of society and environment. Sensitization on different issues of society and addressing them through innovative solutions is the prime focus of the department <br>

<h3> National Cadet Corps (NCC): </h3><p>
NCC is given to all those students who apply for it and is also the default allocation for those who do not make into NSO.
Though the initial process is completed very soon the NCC sessions actually start much later. These sessions are three hours long and are generally held on Saturdays. 
The NCC cadets are allotted their kit which contains two sets of uniforms along with military style boots and a pair of tennis shoes. You also get other stuff to deck yourself up - NCC shoulder pins, a silver coloured badge, a belt, socks and a cap. 
The sessions usually comprise of performing a PT drill and studying some technical details about army organization and artillery (this stuff is usually asked verbatim in exams so you would be better served by listening to it rather than staring sleepily).
A couple of shooting sessions also occur throughout the year which involve interested students being allowed to practice on shooting ranges in Thane. The most important event of NCC is the compulsory annual camp which takes place for 10 days in December right after the first semester.
The camp involves visit to shooting ranges, naval ships and military bases. Further, drill and physical exercises are also an integral part of this camp along with traversal of the obstacle course. The camp ends with a cultural night and prize distribution. Attendance at the camp is mandatory for passing NCC.
The NCC final exams are held in the month of February. It is a written exam of three/four hours duration. Passing this exam along with having a decent attendance will get you the NCC B Certificate and a pass grade in this course.</p>
