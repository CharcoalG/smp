						<h3>Ankit Shah, Aerospace Engg, B.Tech (2013)</h3>
						<p><strong>Motivations behind choosing Aero, expectations and reality</strong>
						<br>
						I always wanted to work with aircrafts and spacecrafts since I was a kid and Aerospace was my first choice in terms of branches. I had read up on basics of principles of flight well before JEE admissions and even JEE preparation. I was aware of what the course of study would include. The reality was quite aligned with what I had thought. The B.Tech course gave a very broad overview of all the sectors involved in Aerospace, including structures, propulsion, aerodynamics, controls and design. The electives in the curriculum allowed me to study a particular area in greater detail.</p>
						<p><strong>Activities you were involved in?</strong>
						<br>
						I was involved with the Student Satellite Project, Pratham for almost 4 years at IIT-B. I

worked with the integration and later the control systems team. I was also involved in 

aeromodelling, first as an enthusiast and later in a managerial role for a year. The student 

involvement in aeromodelling in the last 2 years of my stay at IITB was great. I had also 

made a conscious effort towards my academics and I found most of the courses to be very 

enjoyable.</p>
<p><strong>What according to you are some of the exciting new areas in this field?</strong>
<br>
I think networked constellation of small satellites, autonomous aircrafts, intelligent systems,

more environmentally aware civilian airspace will become key areas in the future. Space 

exploration initiatives are also taking off in India in terms of more advanced science missions 

and more capable launch systems.</p>
<p><srong>What can freshmen expect from the department and IITB, job and higher studies prospects?</srong>
<br>
Placements have a lot to do with individual motivation and initiative. However I can say that

the curriculum was well balanced and provided a good overview of the aerospace sector. In 

addition the institute core curriculum also does a good job of arming one with the tools 

required work in non-aerospace sectors like finance, consulting or management. Higher 

studies is also an option I would strongly recommend. The institute, department and the 

faculty are well known around the world. Many alumni of the department are working 

towards or have completed post graduate degrees in many universities worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>What are you currently involved in?</strong>
<br>
I am currently at MIT and working towards my PhD in Aeronautics and Astronautics. My area

of research is in autonomous systems. I am interested in developing ways for an intelligent 

agent to perform combined task and motion level planning. The scientific and mathematical 

tools I use involve control theory and some basics of planning algorithms.</p>
<p><strong>How did IITB and the Aerospace Department help shape your life?</strong>
<br>
I had a very enjoyable four years at the Aerospace department. I enjoyed the courses and

the learning. I found the faculty to be very approachable and friendly. But above all, the 

thing I value the most was my time with the Satellite project. I learnt a lot about engineering 

by actually working towards building a system and working with others in a team. I found 

great friends amongst the student mentors of the team. I also improved a lot technically in 

preparing and facing the tough questions during project reviews by our faculty mentors. I 

feel I must espcially thank Prof Sudhakar for always being there to guide me in my journey 

through IIT-B right from the Introductory Course, through Pratham and my final year project.</p>
						<h3>Raunak Bhattacharyya, Aerospace Engg, B.Tech (2013) </h3>
						<p>Aviation is the pinnacle of all the engineering disciplines. It is that field where the cream of all 

engineering comes together to help man realize his wildest dream, that of flying. Like most kids, I was 

always fascinated by flying. However, what interested me the most was not just the flying itself, but 

what actually goes into building something that can fly. The undergrad aerospace curriculum set me on 

my first steps to understanding just that. And the journey didn’t end there. I got inspired by what I had 

learnt during my undergrad to pursue post-graduate studies in Aerospace. Currently, I am a doctoral 

candidate in the Aerospace Engineering department at Georgia Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>The professors at IITB AE are renowned experts in their respective fields and are all involved, directly or 

indirectly, in shaping the future of aviation in our nation. They serve as experts on issues of national 

defense and commercial aviation, act as consultants to leading aerospace firms and lead research efforts 

to expand the frontiers of science in general and aviation in particular. Though a bit intimidating at first, 

once you get to know them better, you find a treasure trove of knowledge, experience and insight 

within each and every professor.</p>
<p>Toward this end of getting to know a professor beyond what is taught in class, the AE school offers a 

Supervised Learning Program (SLP) wherein a student works under the guidance of a professor for a 

semester of research. I did two SLPs during my undergrad and I learnt loads from them; not only about 

technical issues but issues relating to how research is carried out in teams, how knowledge sharing is 

done, how to communicate and present and defend your work and how a large scale problem which is 

beyond any you have seen in class can be tackled by breaking it into bits and tapping into the expertise 

and dedication of the team members. I am still using those lessons I learnt today in my research effort 

here at Georgia Tech.</p>
<p>Finally, at IITB, you would be surrounded by gems of people. People so sharp, so motivated and so clear 

in their thought process that you would always have someone to look up to, someone to be strive to be 

better than, someone to be inspired by and someone to learn something from. That is the most 

important thing about IITB in that it teaches you to always set the bar high. It gives you the confidence 

to take on any problem, any challenge knowing that giving it your best shot would most likely result in 

something exciting. At IITB AE specifically, I can confidently assert that I learnt as much from my peers as 

I did from my professors.</p>
<p>Aviation in India is poised for big things and you are going to be the leaders to take our nation onto the 

frontiers of aviation and beyond.</p>
