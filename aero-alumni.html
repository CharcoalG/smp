						<h3>Raunak Bhattacharyya, Aerospace Engg, B.Tech (2013) </h3>
						<p>Aviation is the pinnacle of all the engineering disciplines. It is that field where the cream of all 

engineering comes together to help man realize his wildest dream, that of flying. Like most kids, I was 

always fascinated by flying. However, what interested me the most was not just the flying itself, but 

what actually goes into building something that can fly. The undergrad aerospace curriculum set me on 

my first steps to understanding just that. And the journey didnâ€™t end there. I got inspired by what I had 

learnt during my undergrad to pursue post-graduate studies in Aerospace. Currently, I am a doctoral 

candidate in the Aerospace Engineering department at Georgia Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>The professors at IITB AE are renowned experts in their respective fields and are all involved, directly or 

indirectly, in shaping the future of aviation in our nation. They serve as experts on issues of national 

defense and commercial aviation, act as consultants to leading aerospace firms and lead research efforts 

to expand the frontiers of science in general and aviation in particular. Though a bit intimidating at first, 

once you get to know them better, you find a treasure trove of knowledge, experience and insight 

within each and every professor.</p>
<p>Toward this end of getting to know a professor beyond what is taught in class, the AE school offers a 

Supervised Learning Program (SLP) wherein a student works under the guidance of a professor for a 

semester of research. I did two SLPs during my undergrad and I learnt loads from them; not only about 

technical issues but issues relating to how research is carried out in teams, how knowledge sharing is 

done, how to communicate and present and defend your work and how a large scale problem which is 

beyond any you have seen in class can be tackled by breaking it into bits and tapping into the expertise 

and dedication of the team members. I am still using those lessons I learnt today in my research effort 

here at Georgia Tech.</p>
<p>Finally, at IITB, you would be surrounded by gems of people. People so sharp, so motivated and so clear 

in their thought process that you would always have someone to look up to, someone to be strive to be 

better than, someone to be inspired by and someone to learn something from. That is the most 

important thing about IITB in that it teaches you to always set the bar high. It gives you the confidence 

to take on any problem, any challenge knowing that giving it your best shot would most likely result in 

something exciting. At IITB AE specifically, I can confidently assert that I learnt as much from my peers as 

I did from my professors.</p>
<p>Aviation in India is poised for big things and you are going to be the leaders to take our nation onto the 

frontiers of aviation and beyond.</p>
