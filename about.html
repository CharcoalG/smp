						<h3>Student Mentor Program</h3>
						<p>Mentoring is a particular form of relationship designed to provide personal and professional support to an individual. 
						The mentor is generally more experienced than the mentee and makes use of that experience in a facilitative way to support the development of the mentee. 
						The mentoring relationship provides a developmental opportunity for both parties and can thus be of mutual benefit. 
						In a nutshell, a student mentor's role may be perceived to be facilitative, supportive and developmental for the student community in general and the first year students in particular.<br>

								<h3>ISMP</h3>
								<p>The Institute Student Mentorship Programme, (ISMP) aims at developing a smooth transition to campus life for every new entrant to an academic programme at IIT Bombay. 
								It is for this reason that every entrant is allotted a “mentor” right at the beginning of his/her journey at IITB. 
								These mentors are certain senior students (belonging to final or pre-final year) who are given the authority to attain the mission of this programme. 
								They are carefully chosen from the student community with every effort made to ensure that they are strong in empathy, interpersonal skills, ethics and capable of being a role model for the freshmen. <br>
								<br>Over the course of the year, these senior students regularly keep in touch with their mentees, and continue to mentor them in a multitude of ways. 
								The mentors assist the freshies in the initial phase of adjustment and facilitate the transformation of IITB from an alien place into a second home for the student. 
								The mentor makes his/her experience at IITB available to the freshie and helps the freshie make the right choices at the beginning of his/her IIT life. 
								In addition, the mentor is always available to the mentees, to solve any problem, whether of personal or professional nature, thus making ISMP the most integral part of the support system at IITB for freshmen.</p>

								<h3>D-AMP</h3>
								<p>Department Academic Mentorship Programme, (D-AMP) is active across all departments at IITB, with the primary aim of helping out students who are underperforming academically. Academics at IITB can be unforgiving to students, who aren’t able to cope with it, as well as their peers.
								This can be very demoralising, especially since they have been among the toppers in their school days. D-AMP mentors form the support system for these students and help them realise their true potential by guiding them suitably.<br>
								<br>In each department, the D-AMP is headed by one or two senior mentors (4th/5th year students), who have been a D-AMP mentor for more than a year. They lead a team of responsible mentors, often people who themselves have overcome hurdles and succeeded at IITB, who are capable of empathising with these students. 
								Mentors meet their mentees frequently, often before key junctures in the semester, and help chart out a roadmap for achieving their true potential. They guide them by encouraging them to develop good habits like regular attendance and also give them tips and tricks, to maximise the takeaways from a particular course. <br>
								<br>The mentors work in coordination with the faculty advisor of the D-AMP for their department and also the Student Counsellor, in their efforts to help out their mentees. 
								The D-AMP is also responsible for making sure the smooth running of the Academic Rehabilitation Programme (ARP), for students in the department facing serious academic problems.<br>
								<br>In most departments, the D-AMP also conduct activities for all students in the department to nurture an interest towards academics. 
								These would include organising informative sessions about Honors/Minors, preparing Course Wikis, curriculum restructuring etc. All in all, the DAMPs try to ensure that all students are well-motivated towards academics in their departments.</p>
