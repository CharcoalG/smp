						<span style="font:family=calibri"><h3>Overview</h3>
						<p>Metallurgical and Materials engineers seek to understand the fundamental relationships between the structure, properties, processing and performance of materials. It is this understanding which helps them to synthesize new materials and develop improved processes for producing materials. Moreover, the field of Materials Science and Engineering is one of the most rapidly developing and exciting areas of research.</p>
						<p>The department has received various accolades from industry heads. Lakshmi Mittal, president and chief executive officer of ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker noted that IIT Bombay has a strong Metallurgical Engineering and Materials Science department (November 2007).</p>
						
								<h3>B. Tech Programme</h3>
								<p>The curriculum in the first year is common to all branches of engineering. From the second year onwards students register for different courses in their respective departments. In the second and the third year, students in the Department of Met. Engg. and Mats. Sci., register for fundamental courses such as thermodynamics, kinetics of processes, structure of materials, phase transformations, mechanical behaviour of materials and electronic properties of materials.  Later, the students register for courses which are more applied in nature such as ceramics and powder metallurgy, polymers and composites, Iron and steel etc.  The courses not only provide a fundamental understanding of the subject but also excite the students to explore the vast field of materials science and engineering. Also, students in the program  have the opportunity to pursue an Honors credential by doing five additional courses in different areas of their interest.</p>
								<p>In addition to the theory courses, laboratory courses ensure that the students get hands-on experience in processing and characterization of materials. Besides course work, projects, seminars and presentations also form an integral component of the curriculum, giving the students an opportunity to explore new developments in the field and at the same time earn credits for their effort!</p>
								<p>The various fields and highlights of the department are:</p>
								<h3>Introduction to the World of Materials</h3>
								<p>The department introductory course, the courses on structure of materials, mechanics of materials, thermodynamics and kinetics, help the freshmen slowly settle into the amazing world of metals and materials science. These courses establish a firm foundation for the more specialized and advanced courses to be taught later in the department.</p>
								<h3>Materials Science in the Electronic World  </h3>
								<p>This area pertains to the design and processing of materials used in information transmission devices. Materials research in this field aims at reducing the size of the electronic devices while simultaneously enhancing the device portability and functionality. The students are introduced to this area through courses on modern physics, electronic properties of materials and thin films. The courses in this area cover the following aspects: 
								<ul>
									<li>Understanding how devices work(Physics, Logic flow etc.)</li>
									<li>Exploring materials for the next generation devices which would be of the nanometre scale (basically, really very small!)</li>
									<li>Deposition of thin films of thicknesses for various applications</li>
									
								</ul>
								</p>
								<h3>Extreme Materials (Rocket Propulsion Systems, Hard Materials) </h3>
								<p>From both economic and ecological viewpoints, efficient and environment-friendly propulsion systems are extremely important for future, civil and military, aviation needs. High-temperature materials research is a very interesting and exciting field. Also, exploration and drilling industry require hard materials which can sustain intense wear and tear. Ceramics, composites and super alloys exhibit properties which make them suitable candidates for these applications.The courses in this area cover the following aspects:
								<ul>
									<li>Understanding structure-property relationships in hard materials</li>
									<li>Selection and design of high temperature materials</li>
								</ul>
								</p>
								<h3>Steel Technology</h3>
								<p>It encompasses everything from extraction and processing the ore, to refining and producing steels and alloys. If you think that, surely steels have been over-researched considering they were discovered millenniums ago and that everything is over-n-done, you couldn’t be more wrong. The field is still hot and exciting. New alloys with interesting properties are developed regularly. The research at IIT Bombay predominantly revolves around two aspects - optimizing the current processes and developing new processes in order to increase production, thus saving the industry crores of rupees. </p>
								<h3>Energy and Environmental Materials</h3>
								<p>With the world amidst an ecological crisis, the advent of alternate energy sources and energy storage methods does not come as a surprise. This field, explores materials and devices which would help lessen the burden on the environment caused by conventional energy sources. Current research being conducted at IITB includes Li-ion batteries, high-efficiency solar cells and much more. This is an emerging field and has lots of room for innovation and development. Also, included under this field is research related to finding less hazardous alternative materials for commercial use.</p>
								<h3>Healthcare and Bio-Materials</h3>
								<p>It has been predicted that the next technology boom will occur in the field of Energy, Biotechnology and Biomaterials. In the evolving engineering curriculum, it is time we accepted a little of biology into it. Gone are those days when biology was meant only for the “actual” doctors. The field of healthcare and biomaterials is vast and includes various bio-variants such as Bioinformatics, biomaterials, biomedical engineering. Current research at IIT Bombay includes (and is not limited to) prosthetic materials, glass ceramics, drug delivery nanoparticles. Not only will you get a exposure to some exceptional research carried out in the department, you can also take a couple of introductory courses in biomaterials.  If PhD. is on your mind right now, getting into this field could give you a great start. </p>
								<h3><strong>Dual Degree Programmes and Specializations</strong></h3>
								<h3>1. Ceramics and Composites</h3>
								<p>Ceramics and Composites is a Dual Degree specialization which includes advanced courses in ceramics and composites. The courses on ceramics deal with structure and properties of ceramic materials, processing of ceramic components, properties of ceramics and application of ceramics. Ceramics offer many advantages compared to other materials. They are harder and stiffer than steel; more heat and corrosion resistant than metals or polymers; less dense than most metals and their alloys; and the raw materials used to make most ceramics are both plentiful and inexpensive. Ceramic materials display a wide range of properties which facilitate their use in many different products.</p>
								<p>The courses on composites deal with structure, properties and of composite materials. Composites are materials that result when two or more materials, each having their own usually different characteristics, are combined in order to provide useful properties for specific applications. Advanced composites are rapidly emerging as the primary material for use in aircraft systems because their strength-weight ratio is higher than equivalent metallic structure. Composites are obvious choice for various applications such as golf shafts, tennis rackets, fly rods and fishing rods, hang gliders, skis, light weight mechanical supports for orthopaedic and handicapped people.</p>
								<h3>2. Metallurgical Process Engineering</h3>
								<p>Metallurgical process engineering is a branch of engineering in which a process effects chemical and mechanical transformations of matter, conducted continuously or repeatedly on a substantial scale. Process engineering constitutes the adjustment of process applied to manufacture of bulk or discrete products. Example of bulk product processes include iron and steel making, while example of discrete product processes include casting, moulding, forging, shaping, forming, joining and surface finishing. 
This specialization will provide a student with skills required to set up and run an industrial unit.
A metallurgical process engineer is trained to take up the role of a technical manager in the industry. He/she is proficient in areas of data analysis and process modelling.</p>
<h3>Honors in Metallurgical Engineering and Materials Science</h3>
<p>A B.Tech. student is said to have “Graduated with Honors in Metallurgical Engineering and Materials Science” when she/he has completed a certain number of courses from the honors course list of the Department over and above the normal credit requirement. The exact details of the programme are clearly specified in the Academic Rule Book of the Institute. The department has a fairly flexible honors programme allowing the choice of a great number of courses for Honors requirements.</p>
<h3>Future Opportunities</h3>
<p>Advances in engineering depend on development of critical materials, e.g., the advances made in the areas of healthcare, energy, electronics and photonics, transportation, advanced batteries and fuel cells, nanotechnology are possible due to developments in the field of materials. Students in materials science and engineering obtain a thorough understanding of the fundamentals of materials science and later specialize in topics such as, biomaterials, electrochemical materials science and engineering, computational materials science and engineering, electronic, magnetic and optical materials, and structural materials.</p>
<p>A perfect amalgamation of core courses in different areas, interspersed with a few challenging courses from other departments, makes MEMS among the more interesting departments at IIT Bombay.</p>
